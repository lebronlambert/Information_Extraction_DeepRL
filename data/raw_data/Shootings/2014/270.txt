Five people were injured, two of them seriously, early Tuesday when a man opened fire inside a Highland garage, authorities said.  The victims were inside the garage of an apartment complex in the 25000 block of 5th Street when an unidentified man walked up to the group at around midnight and sprayed them with bullets, authorities said.  Paramedics took the victims to Loma Linda University Medical Center.  The identity of the shooter remains unknown, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. It's also unclear what his motive was or whether the shooting was gang-related.  An 18-year-old woman and a 21-year-old Highland man were listed in moderate to critical condition.  Three other women, ages 21, 23 and 24, were listed in stable condition.  Anyone with information regarding the shooting was asked to call (909) 425-9793 and ask for Det. Donald Patton.
