PITTSBURGH (AP) — Police say a dispute between two groups of men outside a Pittsburgh bar prompted a shooting early Saturday that killed one man and injured five others.  Pittsburgh police say words were exchanged outside Art’s Tavern in the Strip District between members of a motorcycle club called Pittsburgh Gentlemen from Homewood and a group of other men from the city’s North Side neighborhood.  Authorities say one of the North Side men began shooting at members of the motorcycle club. Witnesses saw a black SUV speeding from the scene, with gunfire coming from the front and rear windows.  Police say 40-year-old Tyrone Tomman was killed. Five others were shot and wounded, one critically.  Police say they found a Chevrolet Tahoe on fire three hours after the shooting and believe it might be the same vehicle seen leaving the scene.  (© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
