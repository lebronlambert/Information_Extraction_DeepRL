As all eyes turned to the violent conclusion of Sydney hostage crisis, a different tragedy was unfolding closer to home: A gunman killed at least six and wounded three in Montgomery County, Penn., and remains at large.  Police seek thirty-five year old Bradley William Stone, who authorities believe went on a killing spree Monday morning, with all of the victims related to him. He is described as 5’10” and 195 pounds, with a red beard and short hair. [UPDATE — 5:03 p.m. ET: Stone is reportedly an ex-U.S. Marine.]  The shootings occurred at various sites, some as far apart as twenty miles. Neighbors recounted hearing gunshots at a woman’s house between 4 and 5 a.m., and said a man was seen taking children from the home. Their mother was found dead of a gunshot by police, though the children are reported to have been discovered safe.  At one point Stone was believed to have been cornered; however, he is now believed to be on the loose.  FWIW, the three major cable networks combined for only nine brief mentions of the shooting, compared to blanket coverage of the Sydney hostage situation.
