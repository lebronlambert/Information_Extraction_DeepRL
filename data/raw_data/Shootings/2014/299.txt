A child and three adults are dead after an apparent murder-suicide shooting in South Richmond, according to police.  Police said inside the home, they found three shooting victims: a toddler, an adult woman over 18, and an adult man with what police said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. An additional female victim was found outside the home.  Police confirmed all four victims suffered gunshot wounds, and investigators are working to confirm the relationship between the victims. Preliminary investigation indicates the shooting appears "domestically related," but authorities would not elaborate.A sister of one of the victims talked to NBC12, saying, "To me it's not real yet; it's real but it's not real. I'll never get an answer, I don't know why it happened, we can speculate all day long but we will never know."  Richmond police officers were on the scene within minutes after the call came in around 8:20 p.m. Wednesday. Police are now working to identify the relationship between the four victims, talking to people in the neighborhood to find out exactly what happened. Police said they don't know if the victims all lived at the home on E. Roanoke Street.    Police are confident that the male victim's gunshot wound was self-inflicted, but authorities would not elaborate on who shot the three other victims. However, authorities said they are confident the incident is a murder-suicide.    We have learned the victim's identities but are choosing out of respect to the family to not reveal them right now, as police work to notify family members.    Copyright 2014 WWBT NBC12.
