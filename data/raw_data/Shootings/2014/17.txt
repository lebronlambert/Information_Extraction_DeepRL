Police say one person is in custody following a quadruple shooting at a Manassas, Va. sports bar. (Published Monday, Jan. 20, 2014)  A 24-year-old Manassas man is facing several charges after he allegedly shot four people outside a Manassas sports bar early Monday morning.  Police said Jeremiah Eugene Pullen, 24, became angry after security staff at the 90 Degrees sports bar kicked him out just after 2 a.m. He allegedly got into his car and opened fire as he drove by the entrance of the building.  The bar's manager told News4 that the bar -- located at 8509 Rixlew Lane -- had closed at 2 a.m., so several people were standing outside when the shooting happened.  Police officers arrived to find two men and two woman suffering from gunshot wounds.  Three of the victims were treated at an area hospital and released; the remaining victim is still being hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.  One side of the bar's glass door was shattered, News4's Megan McGrath reported.  Witnesses gave officers a description of the suspect, and a Manassas City Police officer detained Pullen following a traffic stop.  Pullen, who lives in Manassas, is charged with four counts of aggravated malicious wounding, four counts of use of a firearm in commission of a felony, one count of shooting into an occupied dwelling, and one count of shooting from a moving vehicle.  He is being held without bond.
