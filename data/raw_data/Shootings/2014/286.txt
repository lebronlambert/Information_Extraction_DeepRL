NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Four people were shot and wounded Friday night in front of a residence in East Elmhurst, Queens.  Shortly before 10 p.m., police were sent to 32-14 106th St., near Northern Boulevard, where they found four men who had been shot, police said. The victims were all conscious and alert.  A 24-year-old man was wounded in the arm, a 25-year-old man was wounded in the torso and head, another 25-year-old man also was shot in the torso and head, and a 34-year-old man was shot in the right side of his face.  All the victims were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where their conditions were reported as stable.  Witnesses told CBS 2’s Lou Young there was a house party going on at the time.  An investigation revealed that the victims were in front of the residence when the suspects walked up and said hello. One of the suspects then fired at least round with a shotgun before both suspects ran off, police said.  There was no one in custody late Friday and the investigation continued.
