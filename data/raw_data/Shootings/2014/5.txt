(WHNT) - Huntsville Police say a juvenile has been charged in a shooting early Sunday morning at the Bench Warmer Too, a club on University Drive. The club has also lost its liquor license for the time being.  In all, five people were shot during a fight inside the club -- two juveniles and three adults.  Police say the suspect, 15, is charged with five counts of first-degree assault, and is being held at the Neaves-Davis Detention Center. The teen's name is not being released.  Police say the teen has been arrested before, and say the shooting stemmed from a fight inside the bar.  The three adults who were shot are Jordan Darell Baker, 21, John Wesley Brewer, 20, and Craig Allen Shelnut, 31. The names of the two juveniles who were shot are not being released - they are 16 and 17.  The Bench Warmer is listed as a lounge with an entertainment license, and the liquor license stipulates that anyone allowed inside must be 19 years of age or older.  Because several juveniles were present when the shooting took place, Huntsville Police Chief Lewis Morris has suspended the city liquor license. The club owner voluntarily surrendered his license.  Huntsville Police and the Alabama Beverage Control Board (ABC) continue the investigation.
