Six shot in S.F.’s Mission District  Six people were injured in a pair of shootings Wednesday night in San Francisco’s Mission District, police said.  The first shooting happened outside a building near 24th and Alabama streets about 10:15 p.m., said Officer Gordon Shyy, a San Francisco police spokesman.  Officers responding to reports of people yelling and running away found four people suffering from gunshot wounds.  Three were shot in the leg, while one was shot in the arm, Shyy said. All their wounds were not life-threatening, police said.  Witnesses said three to four assailants ran north on Alabama.  About 10:35 p.m., two people were shot near the corner of 15th and Natoma streets. One of the victims ended up being driven onto Highway 101, where the California Highway Patrol shut down a portion of the freeway near Cesar Chavez Street as crews responded and took the victim to a hospital.  Both victims, who were shot in the legs, were expected to survive.  No arrests have been made in either shooting. Police were trying to determine whether thet incidents were related.  Henry K.
