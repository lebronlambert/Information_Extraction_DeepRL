July 13, 2014 at 8:11 AM  A woman was brought to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries after an early-morning shooting in Skyway that involved numerous victims.  King County Sheriff’s Deputy DB Gates said the department received a call of shots fired at about 3:50 a.m. Deputies in the area of 12600 Renton Avenue South were close enough to hear the shots and were on the scene rapidly, she said.  There, they found a small crowd of people behind a strip mall, the site of the former Club Afriq. Five of them, including the woman victim later taken to Harborview, had been hit. It was unclear whether the gunshots came from someone within the crowd or from a vehicle, and the crowd scattered when deputies arrived, Gates said.  Officers were able to stop one car that was speeding away, but the passengers were not believed to be suspects.  Within a half hour, another victim arrived at Valley Medical Center, a third at Swedish and a fourth at Harborview. All were adults and all had been driven to the area hospitals in private vehicles, Gates said. Two of the victims have been confirmed as wounded in the Skyview shooting.  One person was treated at the scene for a grazing wound, Gates said.  No arrests have been made.  “Our officers were there really quickly, but everyone scattered. Nobody wanted to stick around and talk to us,” Gates said.  There is no description of who may be the shooter or shooters, she added. “It could easily have been more than one.”
