One victim was in critical condition but expected to survive, and three others suffered minor injuries, Reading Police Chief William Heim said, according to the Reading Eagle.  The gunman, wearing a mask and dark, hooded sweatshirt, fled after firing several shot inside the All Stars Hair Salon and Unisex Hair Studio just before 3 p.m. It wasn't clear how many customers were inside and whether any were children.  Tuesday night at about 8:15, a gunman in a dark hoodie fired five rounds through the shop's door, but no one was hurt. Several children, ages 4 to 8, were among the nine customers and two barbers inside, the Eagle reported. WFMZ-TV said the children were between 4 and 11 years old.  "The shop had all glass windows, so the suspect had to be able to see inside and obviously had to see there were children inside there," Sgt. John Solecki told the paper.    Police have not yet connected the shootings definitively, but said they were not random. The description of the gunman in both attacks was similar, Heim said.
