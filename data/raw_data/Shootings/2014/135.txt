(Published Wednesday, May 21, 2014)  Officers found 29-year-old William Hill, of Dallas, dead at the scene.  Police have identified a person of interest as 35-year-old Jarmon Phillips, who police say also goes by the name of Ketrick Ford. Investigators believe Phillips might still be in the Dallas area.  "This person of interest has been involved in past conflicts with Mr. Hill which escalated here recently,” said Deputy Chief Gilberto Garza with the Dallas Police Department.  Witnesses told officers that a man with a rifle chased Hill before shooting him several times.  “The suspect came up behind them,” said Garza. “So when they [the victims] turned around, they started running as he [the suspect] started to shoot. So it looks like an ambush.”  Officers said three other people were grazed by gunfire and suffered wounds not believed to be life-threatening. One person was treated at the scene, and the other two were transported to a hospital.  NBC 5's Bianca Castro and Johnny Archer contributed to this report.
