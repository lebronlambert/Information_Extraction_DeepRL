(WMC) â€“ A shooting killed two people and sent three others to the hospital around 2 a.m. Friday. It happened outside of a club in the 2000 block of Chelsea Avenue in Memphis.  When MPD got the call, it was reported that several people had been shot at a motorcycle club called Memphis Gentleman Club.  "A group of young men got into an altercation," said Major Rodney Adair, Memphis Police Department. "One group left and came back and fired some shots inside the club."  Eric Whitaker, 52, died on the scene. Four people were taken to Regional One Health, where Jonathan Tripplett, 26, later died. The three other victims were treated and released into police custody.  With so many shots fired, it was difficult for witnesses to say who was shooting and where the shots were coming from.  Investigators charged Robert Taylor, 35, with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with the shooting.
