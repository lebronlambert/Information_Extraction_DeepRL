Several people were shot at a wedding reception in central Las Vegas on Saturday night.  Las Vegas police said reception guests were celebrating about 11:30 p.m. at El Palacio Del Sol, a banquet hall at 953 E. Sahara Ave., near Maryland Parkway, when an argument erupted and a man shot several of the partygoers.  Lt. Patricia Spencer said the shooter was “basically beaten” by other guests until patrol officers arrived and arrested him.  Spencer didn’t know the number of people shot but said several attendees were injured. She said the injuries were serious but “it looks like everyone will survive.”  Metro’s gang unit continued to investigate the shooting on Sunday morning. Although it wasn’t a gang-motivated shooting, several people at the reception had gang affiliations, Spencer said.  The shooter’s name wasn’t immediately released.
