4 injured in shooting at after-prom party in horse barn  At least four teens were injured when someone opened fire at an after-prom party in north Harris County.  Witnesses told officers that a suspect shot a gun several times after he and a group of friends were asked to leave the party at a horse barn in the 1400 block of Gears near Greens Parkway in the Greenspoint area, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.  Four teens hospitalized with injuries. All are expected to survive, the sheriff's office said.  An altercation at the party, attended by between 200 and 300 teenagers from different high schools, began around 1:35 p.m. when uninvited people arrived after learning about the party on social media. One person opened fire after the group was asked to leave, witnesses and authorities said.  Jimmy Ridings, 21, who works at General Dollar Store across the street, said the alteration started in the barn, but extended to the other side of the street. He was told 15 shots were fired and seven people were injured. One of the victims may be paralyzed, he said.  Janice Brown, who lives near the barn, was shocked to learn about the shooting. She said she didn't hear a single shot fired.  "They shouldn't be doing things like putting their parties up on Facebook," she said. "People will see and they will feel like it's an open invitation to come, and things like this happen."  Anyone with information about the suspect(s) in this case is asked to call Crime Stoppers of Houston at 713-222-TIPS or to submit a tip via the iWatchHarrisCounty phone app.
