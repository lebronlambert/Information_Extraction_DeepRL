WHEAT RIDGE, Colo. - Police are searching for the shooter who opened fire at a hotel in Wheat Ridge early Sunday morning.  At about 1:40 a.m., the Wheat Ridge Police Department received multiple calls of shots being fired during a party at the Howard Johnson hotel near Interstate 70 and Ward Rd.  A witness who didn't want to be identified said several teens were partying in the room next to his late into the night. Then, several cars pulled up outside of the hotel.  "About four or five cars pulled up. They were definitely quick footed. Hindsight being 20/20, I would say they were there for a reason," the witness said.  Police said four people were shot and were being treated at local hospitals. Their conditions are not known but they are expected to survive.  "Those kids got out fast. They were just about running over each other to get out of here," said the witness.  "We are currently looking for a suspect, although a good description of said suspect is not available as of yet," police stated.  Wheat Ridge Police said they were conducting "lots of witness interviews."  A Howard Johnson employee told 7NEWS Reporter Molly Hendrickson that people must now show identification to the receptionist before they are allowed back into the hotel.
