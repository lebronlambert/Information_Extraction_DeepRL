IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION,  DETROIT -  Detroit police said an 18-year-old woman was killed and three others hurt in a shooting late Wednesday night on the city's east side.  Aundrea Garland was spending the night with a friend at a home on Edmore Drive when a red Saturn pulled up and a man, armed with a high-powered weapon, and started shooting at Garland as she stood on the porch.  “The girls were inside, then they were outside on the front porch. The next thing I knew, I heard gun shots,” said the mother of Garland’s friend. “I ran outside and laid down next to her and she just kept telling me, 'Tell my mother I love her.'"  "They killed my baby, they killed my baby. I don't know what I'm going to do without her," said Garland's mother, Margaret. "She was finishing up school, starting her senior year. She loved to sing and was just so beautiful."  Garland was in the process of earning her final credits at Kentwood Alternative High School in Eastpointe.  "Aundrea was at her friend's house because they were going to go back to school shopping today, I cannot believe this happened," said Margaret Garland. "I told her I was worried after the Eastland mall shooting and now she's gone."  Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody said there may be a connection to the mall shooting.  "We are not ruling out that the shooting on Edmore is connected to the shooting at Eastland Mall yesterday, and the shooting on E. State Fair Street morning. Their proximity connects them," Woody said. "If you look at the history of these area it's been quiet, nothing has happened here and now we have three big incidents in two days? That's big."  In addition to Garland, two men, both 19 years old, were shot and are in temporary serious condition. Another man, 18, is in critical.  “This is just so unfair,” said Debbie McCurdy, the victim’s aunt. “She loved everyone she was so innocent, whoever did this, it’s just not fair.”  Police have not released detailed descriptions of the gunman or the three other men who were in the Saturn.
