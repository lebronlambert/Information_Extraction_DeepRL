A shooter that killed one and injured three in Albuquerque Friday is still on the loose.  Police said they found blood splattered around the crime scene.  The shooting occurred in the early afternoon near the 3400 block of Vassar Drive NE. Major cross streets in the area are Candelaria Road and Carlisle Boulevard.  Police have named Marcos Delgado as a person of interest.  Mobile users: Tap for video  Police don’t know how many shots were fired, but witnesses said they heard about a dozen.  “Officers, once on scene, applied tourniquets and provided immediate medical attention (to the victims),” said Ferris Simmons with APD. “I think, clearly, the offender’s considered armed and dangerous."  One witness said he’s related to the people who were shot. Action 7 News is not identifying him because police have not released the names or ages of the victims.  “Some of my family members were shot,” he said. “My sister, her mother and our dog. I was on the phone with my pop 20 minutes prior to the incident."  He said he rushed to the scene after he spoke with his father.  “I called him back and there’s a bunch of people or the place they were in was getting shot up,” he said.  Sky 7 captured video of medics loading someone into and ambulance.  Albuquerque police continue to investigate around these buildings in a northeast Albuquerque industrial park.  Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden was on scene at one point. Violent crimes detectives and the Mobile Crime Lab were as well.  Animal Welfare was seen removing a dog from a nearby building. It's unclear if this activity is related to the shooting.  PHOTO: 4 shot near Carlisle, Candelaria
