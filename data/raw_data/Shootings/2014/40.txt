A teenage boy was killed and three others were injured in a shooting at a McDonald's parking lot in Rogers Park.  Chicago police say a 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in the parking lot at Pratt Boulevard and Clark Street on the North Side. A 14-year-old girl was shot many times. She made her way inside the McDonald's, presumably to hide, and was found in the bathroom. She is hospitalized in serious condition.  Two other teenagers were also wounded. One is in serious condition at a local hospital with a wound to his back; the second teen was hit in his arm.  Faye McCoy was getting her taxes done across the street when the retired nurse heard the gunshots.  "I just knew somebody was shot. I looked over there, I went over there, and the young man is dead. And I end up knowing his mom. He's not a gang banger," McCoy said. "He had been shot in the temple. He died, took his last breath, with me standing there."  It isn't clear if there were multiple gunmen, but witnesses say they heard around six gunshots.  "About six. They weren't all together. There were two and two, and then one and one," witness Robert Congiusti said.  There is gang activity in the area, but Ceasefire said the organization recently brokered a treaty between rivals in the area. They said they believe gang activity had nothing to do with the shooting and that the young man involved was an innocent bystander.  Police have yet to comment on the motive behind the shooting.
