SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” Police are looking for a gunman who opened fire at a crowded nightclub in downtown Salt Lake City, shooting six people.  Hundreds of people fled the Inferno Cantina Night Club after the shots rang out about 11:45 p.m. Saturday. Some of the injuries are serious, but none appear to be life threatening, Salt Lake City police Lt. Craig Gleason said Sunday.  The gunman fled with at least one other person in a stolen black Cadillac CTS that the Utah Highway Patrol found early Sunday about 5 miles away.  Det. Cody Loughy said an armed guard for the club pulled his own handgun and fired at the car, but doesn't know if he hit anything.  "As they were fleeing, it looks like they attempted to run over a security guard," he told the Salt Lake Tribune. "And as he got out of the way, he noticed one of those individuals waving a handgun out of the window."  The suspects remained at large Sunday.  Police are investigating whether the shots were meant for specific people or if it was random fire.  "We have some suspects that we're looking for, but as of yet we don't have them in custody," Gleason told KSL-TV.  "I have no idea how many people were in there, but it's fair to say hundreds," he said. "When you imagine gunfire in that kind of space with that kind of people in it, it's hard to say who was shot with intent and who was hit through random chance."  Someone in the club at the time of the shootings caught the incident on video, but investigators weren't able to view the footage immediately, police said.  ___
