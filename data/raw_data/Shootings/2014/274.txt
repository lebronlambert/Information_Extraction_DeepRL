A drive-by shooting at a gas station on South Orange Blossom Trail early Saturday sent four people in their twenties to the hospital, officials said.  The shooting happened just after 3 a.m. near the Kwik Stop's Kaley Avenue entrance, according to Orange County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Neil Mitchell.  Officials say shots were fired at the group "loitering" near the gas station from a passing vehicle with multiple men inside.  The victims were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, Sheriff's Office spokesman Jeff Williamson said.  The shooting victims have been identified as Thomas May, 26, , Joseph Edwards, 28, , Demetria Childers, 27, and Roger Montgomery, 29.  Deputies continue searching for the suspected gunmen, Williamson said.  A description of the suspect's vehicle hasn't been released.  "There was a description but we rather not put that out considering it may not be accurate," Mitchell said.  Tiffany Walden
