One person was killed and four others injured after a man opened fire at an overnight party early Sunday in East Hollywood to celebrate the upcoming Black Entertainment Television Awards.  The assailant was a lone gunman who is still at large, said Officer Drake Madison of the Los Angeles Police Department.  The shooting occurred at 5:17 a.m., when the gunman fired several rounds, Madison said. Ambulances transported three victims to a local hospital, where one died. The two others arranged their own hospital transportation.  Investigators have not released information about the victims. The coroner’s office said early Sunday that it had not yet received the case.  The shooting occurred at the Monalizza, a restaurant and banquet hall in the 1100 block of North Vermont Avenue. A restaurant manager, who did not give her name, said the shooting had nothing to do with the facility and indicated that it occurred on the patio. She referred all inquiries to the police.  The event itself “was like an after-party even though the awards are tonight,” Madison said. Gatherings associated with the awards take place all weekend.  “There were a couple of parties last night and probably there will be more after the awards tonight,” Madison said.  There is no indication that the Monalizza event was an official one for the awards or its promoters, he said.  The 14th BET Awards take place at 5 p.m. at the Nokia Theatre and will be hosted by Chris Rock.  Twitter: @howardblume
