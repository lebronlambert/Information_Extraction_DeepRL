A 14-year-old girl has died from the injuries she received when a fellow high school student went on a shooting rampage in Washington state.    “Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, known affectionately as Shay to her family and friends, passed away at Providence Regional Medical Centre as a result of severe injuries from last Friday’s school shooting,” the hospital announced on Friday.  The gunman, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, turned the gun on himself after the shootings in which one girl died instantly.  In a brief statement, members of Chuckulnaskit’s family said their hearts were “broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter”.  “She has been a loving daughter, a caring sister, a devoted friend and a wonderful part of our community. We can’t imagine life without her.”  Her death follows that of 14-year-old Gia Soriano, who died of injuries at the same hospital on Sunday.  Chuckulnaskit and Soriano were among three teens, including one boy, who were fatally injured by being shot in the head.  Another boy remained in a serious condition after the rampage after being shot in the jaw.  Police are still trying to find a motive for the incident at Marysville-Pilchuck high school in Marysville, north of Seattle.  Jaylen Fryberg had left a series of posts on Twitter suggesting he was used to handling guns and hinting that a failed romance may have led to the shooting. A memorial service for the boy, a homecoming prince from a prominent Native American tribal family, was held on Thursday.
