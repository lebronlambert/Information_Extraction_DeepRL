Drive-by shooting in Paterson leaves six people wounded  By JOE MALINCONICO  Paterson Press  PATERSON – Six people who were hanging around outside a liquor store were wounded Monday night during a drive-by shooting in a high-crime area of the city’s 4th Ward, police said.  Authorities say none of the victims – four men and two women – suffered life-threatening wounds. Police said they have not determined what precipitated the attack.  The victims were standing near 302 Liquors at the corner of Godwin Avenue and Rosa Parks Boulevard at about 10:35 pm when a dark-colored vehicle heading west on Godwin slowed down as it drove through the intersection and someone inside fired multiple shots at the crowd, according to Lt. Patrick Murray.  So far, Murray said, it seems there was one shooter who was riding on the passenger side of the vehicle.  Murray said police so far are not aware of any disputes that happened in the area earlier in the evening that would have prompted the shooting.  The victims – all Paterson residents – ranged in age from 17 to 61, police said. All are in stable condition at St. Joseph’s Regional Medical Center.  Three of them suffered multiple wounds – an 18-year-old woman hit in the feet and upper body, a 61-year-old man in the feet and a 24-year-old man in the legs, according to authorities. A 45-year-old woman was wounded in the foot, an 18-year-old man in the shoulder and a 17-year-old boy was grazed in the head, police said.  After the shooting, the vehicle sped west on Godwin towards Carroll Street, police said. Authorities have not determined exactly how many passengers were inside.  Police are asking anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Detective Edgar Taylor or Detective Rolando Polio of the Ceasefire Unit at 973-321-1342.
