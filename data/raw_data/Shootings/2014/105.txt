SPRINGFIELDâ€” A total of five gunshot victims were being treated at Baystate Medical Center in connection with two early Sunday shootings in Springfield.  Four people were wounded after they apparently got caught in the crossfire between two rival groups firing at each other outside Lux Nightclub at 90 Worthington St. just before 2 a.m. Sunday.  Springfield police Capt. Harry Kastrinakis said preliminary information indicates the groups were involved in a shootout as people were leaving the nightclub around closing time. An estimated 20 rounds were fired.  Police responded to the scene at 1:58 a.m. Some officers who were within earshot of the gunfire responded within moments. Multiple ambulances were dispatched to the scene.  One shooting victim showed up at Mercy Medical Center for treatment, while four victims were brought to Baystate's trauma unit. None of their injuries were believed to be life-threatening. Some were shot in the torso, but most were hit in the arms or legs, Kastrinakis said.  One victim was shot in the leg in Baystate's parking lot, but Kastrinakis said police were unsure if that incident was related to the shooting outside the nightclub.  Several police police units were stationed near the emergency room entrance as a precaution to prevent any retribution attacks, but gunfire erupted in the parking lot despite the police presence.  Police do not know how many shooters were involved in the downtown gunfight outside Lux. The incident remains under investigation.  Anyone with information is asked to call the Springfield Police Detective Bureau at (413) 787-6355.  This is a breaking story; more information will be posted as it becomes available.
