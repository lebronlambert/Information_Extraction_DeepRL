Deputies are seeking information about the suspects who fatally shot a 15-year-old boy and injured three others at a party in Windsor early this morning.  At 12:47 a.m., sheriff’s deputies responded to a residence on Windsor Avenue after receiving a report of shots fired, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office.  Upon arriving on scene, deputies found a teenage boy who had been shot in the chest. Another juvenile and two adult victims also suffered gunshot wounds.  Two of the victims were shot in the leg and one was shot in the hand. All four victims were transported to the hospital.  Deputies said the teen shot in the chest later died from his injuries at the hospital. His identity has not yet been released.  The other three victims are expected to survive their injuries.  Deputies said the shooting occurred outside a residence where a party was happening and that they have not determined whether the homicide was gang-related, deputies said.  Witnesses described the shooting suspect as a black male wearing a black shirt and sweatpants. He fled the scene in a blue Nissan compact car.  Investigators said a female was driving the car and there were possibly two other passengers in the vehicle. Deputies at the scene interviewed witnesses who were present during the gathering.  Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office Violent Crimes Unit at (707) 565-2185.
