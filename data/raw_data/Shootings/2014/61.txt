Seven people were shot — one fatally — in a gang-related fight early Sunday at a South Dallas nightclub.  The fight began before 1 a.m. at Club BNH in the 2600 block of South Harwood Street, near Grand Avenue. Police said there was a disturbance between rival gangs at the club, which was having a teen event. Armed security broke up the fight with tear gas.  The disturbance escalated outside when people drew guns and began to fire.  When police arrived, they found Terrance Carroll, 21, who was shot and later pronounced dead. Six others were also struck and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.  Eugene Rudd, 22, was arrested on a charge of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. He is being held at Dallas County Jail. Witnesses told police he fired a gun during the disturbance.  Rudd was found guilty of burglary of a residence in 2009 and 2010, according to Dallas County court records. Police say other charges and arrests may be coming.
