Five people were riddled with bullets at the Lexington Apartments around 2 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Three of the five victims are at Regional Medical Center in critical condition.  Neighbors say the shooting happened after a fight at a nearby apartment building. They say the suspects came to Lexington Apartments to settle the score.  The apartment complex was placed on lock down.  "It's just, we're killing each other. It don't make no sense. I'm tired of it. They need... I'm tired of it," said Lakeisha Hobson.  "I pray and ask God to help these police stop all this killing," Beverly Cotton agreed. "All we need to do, some kind of way we need to band together and stop all this killing."  Thomas McKay was at work when his wife called to tell him about the commotion.  "I've been living here for 15 years," he said. "It's dangerous for kids to be out here with that kind of carrying on going on."  Blood and clothing lined streets as dozens of officers questioned witnesses. Police say they are getting conflicting stories about what happened.  "We can't do nothing," Cotton said. "Can't go to the store, they jump us and kill us. Go to the grocery store, get beat up. What could we do to stay safe?"  A woman who did not want to interview on camera said she saw three men speed off in a white car after the shooting.  Police have not yet released a description of the suspect(s). Police say witnesses are not being very forthcoming with information.
