According to partygoers, a young man, possibly in his early 20s, showed up and knocked on the door. They said he opened fire after being turned away."People were drunk and I guess the lady was saying it's time to go, so I guess he took that advantage and went to the car across the street, saw everybody was leaving, he just opened fire," said partygoer Kenneth Johnson."I heard like four shots, the party was over, everybody came outside and then it was about a good 15 more, nonstop," partygoer Andre Spikes said.Spikes and Johnson said they scrambled for cover, dodging bullets.Partygoers broke numerous fences as they tried to escape. Broken glass and bloody clothing were seen outside the home.The shooting remains under investigation. Anyone with information about the incident was asked to call the Riverside County Sheriff's Department at (951) 247-8700.
