It happened in the 4200 block of N. Teutonia Avenue, just after 3:00 a.m. A FOX6 News crew observed shattered glass and car parts strewn in the road in the area on Sunday.  Police say one of the victims -- a 19-year-old man is in critical condition.  Another 19-year-old man, an 18-year-old woman and a 17-year-old female were injured, but are expected to survive.  Police say the teens were in a car, when they were shot by a suspect in another car.  All four teens were taken to the hospital for treatment.  "We just heard a lot of sirens and a lot of gunshots. I actually have a little girl. When we heard the gunshots, we all got to the floor and cut the lights out. It was actually kinda really close," Lakisha Stinson, who lives in the area told FOX6 News.  At the corner gas station, clerk Kittu Singh looked through surveillance video in hopes to find any clues that may have been caught on tape that could lead to the shooter. He says he's especially concerned, considering he know one of the girls who was shot.  "Some teens. Who would shoot at a teen? I'm feeling very bad for her, because I knew her very goodly, and she is a very innocent and good girl," Singh told FOX6 news.  The shooting happened right in front of Reverend Theonita Bedford's place of worship, River Life AME Church.  "We're very concerned about what goes on in our community. We care about our neighbors. It's very surprising and shocking. They are in our prayers today," Bedford said.  "I hope they can find out what happened, and why did it occur?" Stinson said.  The investigation is ongoing.
