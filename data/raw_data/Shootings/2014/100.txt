PHOENIX - Police have identified a man killed when a shooting broke out between two neighborhood parties in Phoenix early Saturday morning.  The victim has been identified as 25-year-old Marcus Hernandez.  Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos said officers responded to a shooting call shortly after 2 a.m. near 55th Avenue and McDowell Road.  Police said two homes across the street from each other were hosting parties and at some point a fight broke out that led to gunfire. Four people were shot, Martos said.  One victim attempted to drive himself to the hospital, but was involved in a crash near 54th Avenue and Cypress. That victim, Hernandez, died due to injuries sustained in the shooting.  The three other victims ended up at local hospitals, he said. Two of the victims, ages 29 and 17, are in stable condition and the third victim, 33, is in critical, but stable condition, said police.  Authorities do not have any suspect descriptions and are asking anyone with information to contact the Phoenix Police Department or call Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS.
