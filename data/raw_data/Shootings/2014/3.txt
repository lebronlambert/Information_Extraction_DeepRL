1 killed, 3 injured in Early Morning Shooting - 6:30 PM UPDATE Posted: Sunday, January 5, 2014 9:38 AM EST Updated: Sunday, January 12, 2014 9:38 AM EST  Shots were fired around 1 a.m. Sunday morning in an East Erie neighborhood, killing a 26-year-old Erie man and injuring another man and two women.    The shooting occurred inside the East Erie Turners building at 829 Parade St., during a private party.  "The victim was pronounced dead at Hamot this morning at 1:28 a.m. by Dr. Beard," said Erie County Coroner, Dennis Suscheck. "My examination did find that he had been shot in the chest."  State police had to assist city police at UPMC Hamot when a large crowd gathered outside the Trauma Center, where the shooting victims were taken.  The three wounded people - a 20-year-old man and women ages 18 and 19, were taken to UPMC Hamot with injuries that police said weren't life-threatening.  Two of the victims have been released from Hamot, as of 5 p.m. Sunday evening.    Detectives tell us about 200 people were at the private party, but witnesses to the shooting are not being especially cooperative. Still, police are optimistic they will be able to make an arrest.  If you have any information, witnesses are asked to call (814)-870-1120.
