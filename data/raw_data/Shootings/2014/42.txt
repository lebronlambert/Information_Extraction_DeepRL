Four Ohio family members are dead after a grandfather apparently gunned down on his wife, daughter and granddaughter in a gruesome triple murder-suicide.  Robert Garza, 68, reportedly shot his wife, Christine, his daughter Zoila and his 15-year-old granddaughter Rebecca at their home on Bowman Road in Defiance County, according to police.  There was no sign of struggle within the family home and a handgun — believed to be the murder weapon — was recovered at the crime scene.  “We don’t see four deaths like this,” Sheriff David Westrick told WANE. “I don’t ever remember it in the 40 years I’ve been around. It’s pretty rare.”  The family was last seen Wednesday night. Police uncovered the horrific scene after an unidentified family member went to check on their condition.  WPTA/WISE A handgun was recovered at the scene and there were no signs of any struggle between the grandfather and his targets, according to investigators.  The grandfather was a Vietnam War veteran and believed to be in declining health, police said.  “It’s just an unfortunate set of circumstances,” Westrick told WANE. “Something that’s going to be really hard to explain. But, these are always hard to understand.”  Police said in a statement that they will continue to canvass the neighborhood Friday morning in search of clues. Defiance County is roughly 60 miles southwest of Toledo.  idejohn@nydailynews.com  Follow me on Twitter: @IrvingDeJohn
