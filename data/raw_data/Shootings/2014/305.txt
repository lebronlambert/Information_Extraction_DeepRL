Devin: WAYNE COUNTY PROSECUTOR SAYS DONNIE EVERETT WAS INVOLVED IN THE SENSELESS SHOOTING THAT STARTED WITH A FACEBOOK FEUD. Carmen: OUR ROGER WEBER WAS IN COURT AS THE CHARGES BECAME OFFICIAL. GOOD EVENING, ROGER! Roger: GOOD EVENING! THIS BRINGS A SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF TO THE GIRL'S FAMILY KNOWING THAT A MAN IS IN CUSTODY AND CHARGED WITH MURDER. FIVE PEOPLE IN ALL WERE SHOT HERE ON MOGUL STREET. AMIRACLE'S TEENAGE SISTER WAS INVOLVED IN A FEUD ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AMIRACLE WAS BARELY OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW HER ABCs. 24-YEAR-OLD DONNIE EVERETT OF DETROIT IS THE MAN POLICE SAY KILLED THE LITTLE GIRL AND WOUNDED THREE OTHERS, CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, FELONY MURDER, FIVE COUNTS OF ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO MURDER AND WEAPONS CHARGES. RELATIVES OF THE GIRL ARE RELIEVED TO SEE CHARGES FILED. I THINK HE DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY BECAUSE FOR ANYBODY TO WALK UP TO A 3-YEAR-OLD AND SHOOT THEM IN THE CHEST TWICE, THEY DESERVE THE DEATH SENTENCE. Roger: THE GRANDMOTHER IS DEVASTATED BUT WILLING TO FORGIVE. I WILL STILL PRAY FOR HIM. Roger: A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE CAME TO THE HOME LOOKING FOR AMIRACLE'S TEENAGE SISTER. HE OPENED FIRE AND THE FATHER FIRED ONE SHOT WOUNDING THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE. THEY TALK ABOUT THE WAR IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, BUT IT'S A WAR HERE IN THE CITY OF DETROIT. Roger: AMIRACLE'S MOTHER WAS WOUNDED AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE FATHER IS STILL A PATIENT. HE'S UPGRADED, IN STABLE CONDITION. EVERETT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN VIRGINIA AND HELD WITHOUT BOND. AND THIS AFTERNOON, THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE CORRECTED THE AGE OF THE DEFENDANT. EVERETT IS 23, NOT 24 YEARS OLD. AMIRACLE'S FAMILY HOPES TO HAVE A FUNERAL ON SATURDAY AND THEY WILL RELEASE DETAILS LATER IN THE WEEK. REPORTING LIVE IN DETROIT, I'M ROGER WEBER, LOCAL 4. Carmen: CERTAINLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE. BUT THESE CHARGES ARE VERY SERIOUS, ROGER. ARE MORE CHARGES COMING? Roger: DETROIT POLICE HAVE SPECIFICALLY SOUGHT A WARRANT AGAINST THE 22-YEAR-OLD DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, THE PERSON WOUNDED BY AMIRACLE'S FATHER AND IS RECOVERING FROM INJURIES.

Video: Man arraigned on charges in 3-year-old's shooting  Everett is accused of being involved in the Oct. 16 shooting on Mogul Street that took the life of Amiracle Williams. Amiracle was caught in the crossfire of gunfire when it erupted outside her family's home.  Amiracle's 47-year-old father, Demetrius Williams, 40-year-old mother, Frieda Tiggs, and 17-year-old pregnant sister, Tkira Steen, were also hit by gunfire.  Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the shooting stemmed from fight between Tkira Steen and another female. It became physical in front of the family's home and Demetrius Williams, armed with a gun, saw the fight and tried to stop it.  Craig said it's unclear who fired the first shot, but that a suspect man who showed up at the home opened fire on Amiracle and her parents with a TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun.  Craig said the suspect and his getaway driver, who was shot, both are in custody. He said the shooter was wanted on an out-of-state warrant.  Worthy didn't clarify Everett's role in the shooting.    -- Amiracle Williams
