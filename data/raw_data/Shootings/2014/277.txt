A triple homicide that killed a mother and left her child in critical condition had investigators working late into Sunday night on a crime scene police could only describe as “complex.”  When police arrived at a shooting in the 200 block of Sailfish Court about 7 p.m. Sunday, they found two women and one man dead outside different residences in the Marina Village trailer park. One child suffered gunshot wounds and was transported to Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial.  Police have not identified the victims.  “It’s a tragic day when we lose a citizen and we lost three. It’s tragic for family and the residents,” Capt. Michael Alanis said.  Neighbors and witnesses helped police locate the suspect, a 63-year-old man who police have not identified. He could face charges of capital murder because of the number of people dead.  Police interviewed numerous Marina Village residents and could not immediately determine a motive for the shooting.  Blue and red lights reflected on the white picket fence surrounding the park as residents watched multiple crime scene investigators and police vehicles drive under the yellow and black crime scene tape.  Sheri Elpe said she was working nearby when she heard gunshots.  “I’ve lived here 13 years and there’s never been anything like this,” she said.  Alanis said detectives will continue to work into Monday morning and release details as they become available.
