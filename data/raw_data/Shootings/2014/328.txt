TABERNACLE, N.J. (AP) â€” A New Jersey woman who authorities say shot all three of her children, killing two of them, before turning the gun on herself died Sunday from her injuries, state police said.  The death of 44-year-old Jeannine LePage came three days after the shootings at the family's home in Tabernacle, a town in the New Jersey Pinelands that's 30 miles east of Philadelphia.  Authorities say LePage used a handgun that had been purchased legally and was in the family for decades. They say she used a pillow to muffle any noise so five other relatives who lived in the home wouldn't hear what was happening when she shot her children Thursday morning.  Authorities have not said what may have prompted LePage to shoot her children, saying it was a mystery that may never be solved.  Fourteen-year-old Nicholas Harriman and 8-year-old Nadia were killed. Their 11-year-old brother, Alexander, was wounded and remains hospitalized in "extremely critical condition."  LePage and her children were found in the same bed by a family member who called 911, police said. The two children killed in the shootings were pronounced dead at the scene.  The children's father did not live in the house.  ___
