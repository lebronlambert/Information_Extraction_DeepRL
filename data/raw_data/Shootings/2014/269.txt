Police arrested a man armed with a gun who was walking along I-29 about midnight. He has been identified as the suspect in assaults at a nearby motel, police said, and they are investigating whether he is connected to a shooting rampage earlier Tuesday in a south Kansas City neighborhood. Three people were killed and two were seriously wounded.
