IRVINGTON — Six people were injured after a large fight escalated into a shootout Sunday afternoon, according to police.  Sgt. Patrick Brennan of the Irvington police said officers arrived at 36 Welland Avenue at around 3:08 p.m. to investigate a report of a large fight when they found a woman suffering from a gunshot wound to her leg.  As officers canvassed the area, they located five additional male victims, all of whom had also been shot in the arms or legs, Brennan said.  All were taken to area hospitals to be treated for the injuries, which were not deemed to be life-threatening.  Brennan said police have not been able to discern how the fight began or whether one or more people may have been responsible for the shootings. No arrests have been made, though he said detectives are pursuing “strong leads” in the case.  Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Irvington police at (973) 399-6603.
