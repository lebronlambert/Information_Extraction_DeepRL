ELIZABETH â€” The four men shot at a community center last night were standing in the vestibule when masked men approached and opened fire, police said.  Two of the victims, ages 24 and 21, are from Elizabeth, according to police. The other two, ages 25 and 30, are Newark residents. No additional identifying details have been released.  The men were shot at 10:16 p.m. in front of the Mickey Walker Center at 860 Anna Street. The community center, operated by the city's Department of Recreation and Office of Youth Services, closes at 10 p.m. on Tuesdays.  The group was approached by three men in dark masks and black hooded sweatshirts, who pulled out at least two guns and started shooting, Lt. Daniel Geddes wrote in a statement.  Each of the four men who had been standing in the vestibule was struck by gunfire. The three suspects then ran in an unknown direction, Geddes said.  All four victims were taken to University Hospital in Newark and remain there this morning, police said. Three are in stable condition, and the fourth is in serious condition.  The Elizabeth Police Department and EMS crews from the Elizabeth Fire Department responded to the shooting.  An "intensive investigation" is ongoing, Geddes said.  Police ask anyone with information to call Detective Yohara Barrios at (908) 558-2103 or the detective bureau at 908-558-2050.
