Berkeley County deputies are still looking for a suspect in an overnight shooting that left one person dead and four others injured following an incident at a block party in the Long Ridge community, according to sheriff's office spokesman Dan Moon.    Deputies responded to an address on Tish Lane about 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning and found five victims at the location with gunshot wounds. All victims were transported to area hospitals where one died of her injuries.    Berkeley County Coroner Bill Salisbury said 19-year-old Ariel Morgan of Moncks Corner died at MUSC at about 2:45 a.m.    According to witnesses at the scene, the incident began at a block party when someone began firing shots towards a group of people who were dancing. Things then escalated, as some people went to their vehicles to grab guns.    Witnesses say gunshots were going off for 30 minutes.  A former classmate of Morgan's said the teen feared violence could be on the way, even voicing her concern on Twitter the day of the party.    Morgan posted the following tweet from her Twitter account @_relllll_ on Friday at 4:52 p.m.: Charleston Most Ratchets pls stay your (expletive) home, some of us want our life's and just want to have a good & safe time. thank you - rellll.
