The gunfire injured four people early Sunday at VFW Post 2999 on English Avenue.  Police arrested 20-year-old Vernell Ballard for resisting law enforcement.  Police say a fight broke out inside the VFW hall, which had been rented to a group that brought its own security.  The fight spilled out into the parking lot and down the road where the shots were fired.  Police say Ballard was driving one of two cars officers chased as people sped away from the scene.
