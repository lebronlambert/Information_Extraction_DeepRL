Authorities say a pregnant woman and her unborn child were killed along with three other people in a shooting at a Cleveland home on Friday. The womanâ€™s 9-year-old daughter was wounded; her toddler son was unharmed.  Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams said 41-year-old Sherita Johnson was 28 weeks pregnant. A 17-year-old girl and two men, aged 19 and 60, were also killed in the Friday night shooting. Their identities were not immediately released.  Police said on Saturday that Johnson apparently arrived home with her children and allowed her daughter to go inside for clothes. Investigators say a masked gunman ran toward the girl and shot her, grazing her chest.  Authorities say the suspect then shot Johnson in her vehicle. Her 2-year-old son was in the backseat.  Police have not determined a motive.
