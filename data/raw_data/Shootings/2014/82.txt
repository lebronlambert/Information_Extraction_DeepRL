A star high school basketball player is among six people shot at a party in Chicago and police are still looking for the man who opened fire.  "The boys are 16-17 years old, they know their friend got shot," said Orr Academy basketball coach Louis Adams. "Teammate is second, but their friend is first and the boys are taking it pretty hard."  At 19 years old, senior forward Tyquone Greer is one of the stars of Orr Academy's basketball team. At least he was, until early this morning, when a shooting broke out at a party he was at in the Austin neighborhood.  Greer was shot in the leg, five others, also injured. Speaking on Greer's behalf Sunday night was head coach, Louis Adams.  "Let's just find the guy who did it so he won't strike again and hurt someone else," he said. "Next guy might not be as fortunate as Tyquone Greer."  Police say the shooting took place around 3:30 a.m. Sunday, after an argument broke out between two of those present at the party. They say the shooter left, came back with a gun and began shooting.  Speaking to us over the phone earlier, a close friend said Greer was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and that his main concern now is not his high school basketball career, which is likely over, but the well-being of close friend Deshawn King, a former Orr player who Adams confirms was shot three times and is still hospitalized.  "Deshawn King played with me two years ago," the coach said. "He was attending the University of Asheville in Iowa. I went over to see Deshawn, he's getting better."
