Memphis police officers are investigating a shooting at a bikini bar that sent four people to local hospitals on Friday morning.  Police were called to Pure Passion at 1849 East Brooks Road just before 4 a.m. where multiple shots were fired in the parking lot.  Two victims, ages 19 and 24, were taken to Regional Medical Center. The 19-year-old victim is in critical condition. The 24-year-old victim was shot in the leg; she is in non-critical condition.  An 18-year-old victim was driven to the hospital by someone who was on the scene. A fourth victim was driven to Methodist University Hospital. He was shot in the arm and listed in non-critical condition.  According to investigators, the shots were fired into a crowd from someone in a white car.  Keto Brown was in his hotel room, not too far from the crime scene.  "I did hear the gunshots in the hotel, but I didn't think nothing of it because in this area, it's like that sometimes," he said.  Randy Williams, who is the club's Promoter, said the shooting happened next door rather than on their property.  "There was no problem inside the club. No shooting on this parking lot," he said. "Everything went good for the night."  The Thanksgiving Day shooting is not the first time Pure Passion has been in the news. In 2008, Shelby County District Attorney's Office shut the club down for illegal drug use and drug sales following a 4-month-long investigation.  The club eventually reopened.  Most recently, in April 2014, a 25-year-old man was killed and another was rushed to the hospital after witnesses told police someone opened fire into their car.  "There has been a few problems before, but recently we haven't had any problems at all," Williams added.
