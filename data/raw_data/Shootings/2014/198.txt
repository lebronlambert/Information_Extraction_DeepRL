One dead, three injured in drive-by shooting  One person is dead and three others are injured after a suspect shot into an occupied car early Sunday morning, Las Vegas Metro Police said.  Shortly before the incident, the victims had been involved in a physical altercation at a party in the 3300 block of Corona Del Mar Drive, near Jones Boulevard, but police are unsure whether the suspects in the shooting are the same people with which the victims had been fighting.  Police responded to a call at 5:01 a.m. in the parking lot of a convenience store in the 3400 block of North Rancho Drive, where they found four victims with apparent gunshot wounds.  The victims had been driving to an intersection near Jones Boulevard and Cheyenne Avenue when the front passenger of what was reported as a white, four-door Honda Civic driving alongside the victims pulled out a gun and opened fire, police said.  The suspects drove off and the victims drove to the convenience store to call police.  One of the victims was pronounced dead at the scene while three others were taken to University Medical Center for treatment, police said.  This is Metro's 72nd homicide so far this year.
