The police said that it was not clear how the gunman, identified by the authorities as Ronald Haskell, was related to the victims, but that he was married to a relative of the homeowners, who were among those killed.  “It was a domestic situation involving a divorce, but beyond that, we’ve had no statement from him,” Ron Hickman, a Harris County constable, said.  Mr. Hickman said that on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Haskell drove to the relatives’ house in Spring, Tex., “gathered up the children that were here and awaited the arrival of the parents.”  Mr. Haskell, the police said, then shot and killed six people, whose names or ages have not yet been released. Five members of the family were found dead by the police when they arrived at the house. A sixth victim died at a hospital.  A 15-year-old girl who was in the house and was wounded after being struck by a bullet in the head called the police and told them that Mr. Haskell was probably on his way to a house where other family members lived. The police arrived at the second house first, and Mr. Haskell led them on a low-speed pursuit, the authorities said.  Eventually, officers shot out the tires of Mr. Haskell’s car, and he pulled into a cul-de-sac, where he was surrounded by the police. Several hours later, after speaking to a hostage negotiation team, Mr. Haskell surrendered, the police said. A handgun was found in his car.  The 15-year-old girl who had been wounded was airlifted to a hospital for emergency surgery, the authorities said.
