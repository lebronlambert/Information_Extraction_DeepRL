A 12-year-old North Carolina boy remains in critical condition after being shot in the head while playing on a church playground.  Rocky Mount Police spokesman Cpl. Michael Lewis said Wednesday that the condition of Nyreek Horne remains unchanged a day after a gunman sprayed more than 15 bullets toward a crowd playing basketball behind the Word Tabernacle Church. Three other males, ages 13, 17 and 19 - were all treated and released.  Witnesses could provide only a vague description of the shooter, who ran away and was seen getting into a small, light-colored SUV. Rocky Mount police are offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads them to a suspect.  The shooting came days after 15-year-old Brian Freeman was shot and killed nearby.
