ST. LOUIS • Five young men, from 15 to 27 years old, were wounded in a shooting near Thekla Avenue and Union Boulevard about 1:50 p.m. Sunday, police said.  One was in critical condition but all were expected to survive, said police Lt. James Prost. He said they were not cooperating with officers trying to determine what happened.  Prost said police were dispatched to a report of a fight and were told while en route that a shooting had occurred. It appeared that all five were shot in the 5200 block of Thekla, but one victim ran and fell in the 5100 block.  At least one person is reported to have fled from the area. Prost said no guns were recovered at the scene.  He said the most seriously hurt was the 15-year-old, hit multiple times in the lower back. Others had various wounds in the side, foot, hand and leg.  A resident of the area, Ronald Baker, 43, said he did not see the attack but heard at least 16 shots in rapid succession that he said may have come from one automatic weapon.  Police told about 75 people in a worship service at Unity Chapel Church, 5250 Thekla, to remain inside so as not to tramp through the crime scene, said Assistant Pastor James Patty.  Patty lamented the violence. “It’s time for this to come to an end,” he said. “It’s got to stop. It’s senseless.”  He said people in the church were unaware of the shooting outside until someone came in to say the area was swarming with police.
