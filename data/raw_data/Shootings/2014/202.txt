The man responsible for fatally shooting two people and wounding a sheriff's deputy has been identified.Alex Anderson, a 34-year-old Moreno Valley resident, was the gunman found dead in some thick brush near the northern terminus of Pigeon Pass Road, said sheriff's Deputy Albert Martinez.Investigators found Anderson's body after a manhunt that lasted more than 24 hours.Sheriff's officials said Anderson's shooting spree began at an unknown time on Tuesday, July 22, inside a house in the 25500 block of Delphinium Avenue. The victim was identified as 58-year-old Derek Hardy of Moreno Valley.The second shooting was reported at 2:24 p.m. about seven miles from the house at a Shell gas station at Sunnymead Ranch Parkway and Old Lake Drive. The victim, 74-year-old Wilma Patterson, was found dead in her vehicle.Anderson does not appear to have a criminal record in Riverside County.Witnesses described the suspect's vehicle, and deputies found it abandoned on Pigeon Pass with a man matching the description of the suspect several hundred yards away.Several deputies rushed to the area and when one of them tried to talk to the man, he opened fire.The deputy was wounded, and the suspect also started shooting at Enrique Lerma, 48, and son Jacob, 21, a father-son pair of landscapers who were working nearby, they said.Paramedics took the deputy, whose name has not been released, and the landscaper to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The gardener suffered a broken hip, his father reported, and the deputy was doing fine by Friday, July 25, the sheriff's spokesman said.Few details were released on what may have triggered the shooting spree, but Martinez said Anderson was "known to the victims."This story is developing.For updates, check back on this page or follow the author on TwitterÂ @PeterSurowski Â andÂ like him on Facebook.
