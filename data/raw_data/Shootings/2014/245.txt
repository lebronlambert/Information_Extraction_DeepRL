A 16-year-old boy is in critical condition following a shooting that left three others injured late Wednesday night (Aug. 13) in the city's 7th Ward, New Orleans police said.  The teenager was riding in a car driven by a 19-year-old man when an unknown gunman opened fire sometime around 10:40 p.m. near the intersection of New Orleans and North Rocheblave streets, according to NOPD spokeswoman Officer Hilal Williams.  The younger man was shot in the stomach and back, Williams said, while the 19-year-old was hit in the ankle and managed to drive the pair to an area hospital.  The shooting also left a 22-year-old man with gunshot wounds to his leg and thigh, as well as a 59-year-old man with a graze wound to his back, Williams said. Those injuries were not life threatening.
