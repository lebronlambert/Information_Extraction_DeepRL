Authorities have arrested a man accused of killing two people and wounding three others Thursday night in a trailer park off of County Road 934 in Weir, a small town in central Williamson County.  Jose Hernandez Benitez, 24, was arrested Friday in Caldwell County, where he fled after the shooting, said Fred Thomas, a spokesman for the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office. Benitez was transported to the Williamson County Jail on murder charges.  Benitez had been sending text messages to Yazmin Corona about wanting to date her, Williamson County District Attorney Jana Duty said. At a party Thursday night, Corona and Omar Ruiz were talking about the text messages and mocking Benitez, which put Benitez “over the edge,” Duty said. Benitez opened fire, killing Corona and Ruiz, authorities said.  Three other people — Rene Ortega, 26; Sujeil Perdomo, 38; and Miguel Reyes, 34 — were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Thomas said.  A witness told deputies that Benitez and Ruiz worked together at Dos Salsas restaurant in Cedar Park.
