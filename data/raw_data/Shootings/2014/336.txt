Bates, The Chronicle 6 shot, wounded outside hip-hop show in S.F.’s Mission District 1 / 3 Back to Gallery  Six people were wounded early Wednesday when a gunman opened fire in a crowd outside a hip-hop concert at a Mission District nightclub, San Francisco police said.  San Francisco rappers G-Val and Show Banga had performed a sold-out, 18-and-over show at the Brick and Mortar Music Hall at Mission Street and Duboce Avenue, and dozens of people were gathered on the sidewalk outside when the shooting occurred at 12:46 a.m.  The shooter fled the scene before police arrived, and investigators offered few details of the incident. No arrests were reported.  “There were people running all around the streets, and the cops came from every which way,” said Cody Haven, who lives next to the club, watched the crowds disperse after the gunfire and saw one of the victims lying in the street outside his home.  Six people were hit by gunfire, said police spokeswoman Sgt. Monica MacDonald. One person was shot in the upper body and another person was hit in the head, while other victims were hit in their legs or arms. All are expected to survive, police said.  Show Banga, a rapper from the Fillmore neighborhood, released a statement on his Instagram account expressing frustration with the shootings.  “Me and G-Val was trying to do a positive event for our city and neighborhood,” Show Banga said.  He also tweeted, “One day these lil lames a grow up and wanna get some money instead of tryna beef all the time life so much bigger than that man smh.”  Evan Sernoffsky and Kurtis Alexander are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.
