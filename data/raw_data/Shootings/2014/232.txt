Albuquerque police are searching for a man who officers said shot four women Friday, killing one of them.  Police said Marcos Delgado shot and killed his ex-girlfriend Anna Vigil at an auto detail shop on Vessar in northeast Albuquerque in what police called a “jealous fit of rage.”  Vigil was in her car outside of the shop around 12:30 p.m. and was talking to her boyfriend who works there.  Police said Delgado sent Vigil several threatening text messages about 20 minutes before the attack because he was upset about her new boyfriend.  According to the arrest warrant, Delgado spotted the boyfriend leaning into Vigil’s car to talk to her, and decided to ram him with his car.  The boyfriend told police he then took cover and saw Delgado take out a handgun and fired several shots at him and Vigil.  He said Delgado ran around the back side of the building and inside of the shop to warn people when he heard more gunshots.  Three women inside of the shop were hit, including one who is pregnant.  Bullets also hit a dog.  Police expect the women and the dog to be OK.  One of the women has since been released from the hospital.  Vigil died from her injuries.  Adam was not hit.  Police located Delgado’s car on Saturday.  They are still looking for him.  APD has enlisted several local and state agencies like the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department, New Mexico State Police, the U.S. marshal, the FBI, and Homeland Security to help with the search.  Delgado does have a prior criminal record.  According to court documents, Delgado had been arrested for battery against a household member in 2002. The charge was dropped, but it can later be refiled.  In 2005 court records show Delgado was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest and possession with the intent to distribute.  All of the charges were dismissed expect for the distribution charge, which he pleaded guilty to.
