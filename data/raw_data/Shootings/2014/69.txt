Chief Hite briefs on shooting (WISH Photo/ Kevin Hankins)  INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirms four officers were shot on the southeast side Wednesday, and all are expected to be okay.  The suspect in that shooting was shot and killed.  The incident occurred in the 1600 block of South State Avenue, near the intersection of State and Minnesota. Officials say SWAT team officers were serving a high-risk narcotics search warrant at a known drug house in that area. As they were entering the home, while announcing “police search warrant,” the suspect started firing at officers. Officers shot back, killing the suspect. That suspect is believed to be the intended target of the narcotics investigation.  Officials say four SWAT team officers were shot by the suspect’s gunfire. All officers are expected to be OK and were taken to area hospitals. Officers originally said only one officer was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital. We’ve since learned two officers were taken to Methodist, and one to Eskenazi Health with non-life threatening injuries. One officer was treated at the scene and released.  IMPD said in a midnight update, officers are alert, conscious and listed in good condition. Two officers are expected to remain hospitalized overnight for observation and another officer has been released from the hospital.  Officials said bullet proof vests saved the lives of the officers.  IMPD officials say there were four other people in that home at the time of the shooting and they weren’t hurt. Investigators said they’re familiar with the house, and they believe illegal narcotics were being sold inside. They haven’t yet released the name of the suspect.
