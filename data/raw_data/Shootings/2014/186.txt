A shooting at an Eastern Kentucky home sent four people to the hospital.  Kentucky State Police are working to figure out how the four victims were shot early this morning in the Stopover Community of Pike County.  That's about three and a half miles outside Phelps.  Police at the KSP post in Pikeville aren't releasing many details about the shooting.  Police say they received a 911 call around 4:00 Monday morning about a shooting at a trailer. When troopers got there they found four people who'd been shot.  Three men and one woman were airlifted to Pikeville Medical Center.  One of the victims is out of the hospital.  The names and conditions of the other three have not been released.  So far, no arrests have been made.
