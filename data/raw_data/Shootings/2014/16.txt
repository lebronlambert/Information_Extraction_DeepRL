Four people were shot and wounded in a drive-by incident at a Manassas sports bar early Monday, and police have arrested and charged a 24-year-old man in the case.  Police said Jeremiah Eugene Pullen of Manassas was charged with malicious wounding and related counts in the incident and was being held without bond. Three of the four victims were treated and released at area hospitals, and the fourth, a woman, was still in the hospital Monday morning with injuries not believed to be life-threatening, police said.  The incident occurred just before 2:30 a.m. at the 90 Degrees bar on Rixlew Lane, police said. They said Pullen was ejected from the bar just before 2 a.m. because he was acting disorderly and the bar was preparing to close. As other patrons left, police said, Pullen went to his vehicle, drove by and opened fire, wounding two men and two women.  Officer Jonathan Perok, a Prince William County police spokesman, said Pullen did not seem to be targeting anyone. Perok said that although some bullets hit the bar’s glass door, all those struck were outside.  Police broadcast a description of Pullen’s vehicle, and a Manassas City officer soon stopped and detained him, authorities said.  Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail
