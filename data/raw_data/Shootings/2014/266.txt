Suspect arrested in Livermore house party shooting  Authorities arrested a suspect on suspicion of five counts of attempted murder Sunday after he allegedly opened fire on a house party in Livermore, police said.  Around 12:30 a.m., officers heard shots coming from a home on the 200 block of South Q Street. Authorities swarmed to the home and immediately began rendering aid after finding multiple shooting victims, police said.  The shooting happened after three men, who were invited to the party, were asked to leave when they got into an argument with another person, police said.  The men left, but about half an hour later, police said a white sedan pulled up in front of the house, and someone got out and opened fire on guests at the 20-person party. The sedan then sped off.  Three women and two men were shot and rushed to local hospitals. Authorities did not name the victims or give details about their conditions, but said they were adults ranging in age from late teens to early 20s.  At 8:23 a.m. police arrested 21-year-old Anthony Jesus Torres during a traffic stop on suspicion of five felony counts of attempted murder, shooting into an inhabited dwelling and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  Police detained two other people in the vehicle and later released them after they were questioned.  Torres is due in court Tuesday for arraignment.
