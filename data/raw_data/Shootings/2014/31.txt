A police source says at least five victims (all juvenile males) sustained non-fatal gunshot wounds to the legs from shotgun pellets.  Police say the ages of the victims range from 11 to 17.  According to police, multiple individuals were in a basement when a shotgun containing birdshot was brought into the room. Multiple persons handled the weapon and it discharged, causing minor injuries to five of the people who were in the room.  Neighbors say they're sick of violence on their street.  "Like somebody got shot. Police down here and somebody got shot over here. It's bad out here. It's a bad environment," Chrishaya Covington said.  FOX6 News spoke with a neighbor who is underage, who says just days ago, she was hanging out with friends inside the home that is now a crime scene.  "They're my friends. They're like, the people I hang out with. I hope ain't nothing bad happened to any of them. We lost too many people over here already. They should be laying low and trying to chill out," the girl told FOX6 News.  Monitor FOX6 News and FOX6Now.com for updates.
