SAN BERNARDINO >> Four women and a man were wounded by gunfire early Tuesday at an apartment complex near Fifth Street and Del Rosa Avenue in San Bernardino.  Shortly after midnight, deputies arrived at the apartment and found the five, aged between 18 and 24, with gunshot wounds, sheriff’s officials said.  The victims were taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center for treatment.  Officials say three of the victims are in stable condition, but two are in moderate to critical condition.  Deputies determined that the victims were hanging out in a garage in the apartment complex when an unknown man walked up and opened fire.  The motive for the shooting was unclear and the suspect is still at large, officials said.  Officials are unclear if the shooting is gang related.  Jodi Miller, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, said later Tuesday that there is no additional information regarding the case, including an arrest or the frequency of shootings in that area.  Anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff’s Highland station at 909-884-0156.  Staff writer Grace Wong contributed to this report.
