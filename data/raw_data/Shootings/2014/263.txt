Local media said the victims were an elderly couple and their two severely disabled adult children. Police said they were investigating the incident in Elmhurst, about 18 miles west of Chicago, but there was no threat or danger to others.  The bodies were discovered Saturday evening after Elmhurst police went to the home for a “well being check,” police said in a statement, identifying the four dead as Francis and Joan Stack, both 82, Francis Stack Jr., 48, and Mary Stack, 57, Elmhurst.  The Chicago Tribune, citing DuPage County court records, said the adult children of the elderly couple suffered from severe mental disabilities and were in residential care programs but came home nearly every weekend.
