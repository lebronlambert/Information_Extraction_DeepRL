× Sacramento Drive-by Shooting leaves 4 Wounded  SACRAMENTO-  3 men were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening gunshot wounds after neighbors say they witnessed a drive-by shooting in the 6500 block of 46th Street.  “Just us outside sitting by the stairs, drinking beer, singing a couple songs, haven a good time. First they were speeding and they stopped around here. Started shooting up in the air, kept going , turned around and started shooting at us,” sag Farlick Pau.  Pau said he and his 3 cousins were shot at while sitting on a staircase outside of their apartment complex.  However, a witness told FOX40 the gunfire was exchanged from one vehicle to another.  “A dark SUV, 4 door pulled up next to a white Ford Focus, unloaded 6 rounds into the vehicle. Fled the scene,” said the witness.  Pau told FOX40 the suspects shot from a tan colored SUV, and that he and his cousins were not standing by or sitting inside of another car.  The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department said they got conflicting stories from different people they interviewed on scene. They also said many of the witnesses were intoxicated and uncooperative.  “The guys that got hit were ones who don’t get involved in the streets. They just work, come back, and take care of their families. That’s it,” said Pau.  “Unfortunately, that’s just part of living in Sacramento,” said the witness.
