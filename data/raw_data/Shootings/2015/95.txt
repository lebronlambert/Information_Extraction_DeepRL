ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Police fatally shot a man in a northern Virginia apartment building Tuesday morning after they heard screaming upon arrival for a domestic-disturbance call, authorities said. Two officers were injured.  Officers arrived at the building in Arlington about 11 a.m. and confronted a man, Alfredo Rials-Torres, 54, according to Arlington County Police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck. Rials-Torres died after being taken to a hospital. Police also tried to revive him at the scene, Sternbeck said.  Two officers who responded to the call suffered significant but non-life-threatening injuries. One officer was shot by a stun gun, and the other suffered a serious cut to his face, authorities said. A woman in the residence also suffered minor injuries.  Both officers were taken to a hospital, and one was undergoing surgery, according to a tweet on the Police Department's Twitter account.  Sternbeck said he did not know the age of the woman who was hurt or her relationship to the man.  Several hours after the shooting, a large police presence remained in the neighborhood. Officers were using what looked like surveying equipment to take measurements outside the home.  By midafternoon, Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney Theo Stamos arrived and went inside the residence with police. Stamos said her office automatically reviews shootings involving police, but otherwise she declined to comment.  Sternbeck said the investigation is continuing and that the sequence in which the officers and Rials-Torres sustained their injuries is not yet clear.  The apartment complex is in Buckingham Station, a working-class neighborhood of Arlington, a few blocks south of the county's busy Ballston district.
