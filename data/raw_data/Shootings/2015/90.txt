The shooting took place Saturday evening, May 16th.  Authorities say a crowd had gathered in memory of 18-year-old Kendrai Walker killed Friday night, May 15th near 28th and Burleigh.  Police say the large group of people was in the alley when at least one person fired several shots.  Five people suffered gunshot wounds: three women, ages 57, 52 and 24 -- and two men, ages 23 and 21.  FOX6 News spoke with a man who was here when it happened. He tells us at least part of the group was participating in a community clean up and then they were having a vigil for the 18-year-old man who was shot and killed Friday night at 28th and Burleigh -- and that's when Saturday's shooting happened.  "After we met up, people just started shooting at us and stuff, and you know, I had to take off running. So many shots rang out I had to get up out of there," said John Jackson, witness at the scene.  Jackson tells FOX6 News, one of the victims shot was the mother of Kendrai Walker who was shot and killed Friday night.  Police say all five victims received non-life threatening wounds and are being treated at a local hospital.  There are no suspects in custody at this time as authorities are still investigating this incident.
