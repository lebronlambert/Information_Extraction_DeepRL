LOS ANGELES >> One person was killed and four others were wounded Thursday as gunfire erupted in the Palms section of Los Angeles, prompting two schools to go on lockdown and police to go on tactical alert.  The gunfire was first reported just before 3 p.m. when two people were shot at Woodbine Park at the intersection of Woodbine Street and Vinton Avenue, said Officer Jack Richter of the Los Angeles Police Departmentâ€™s Media Relations Section.  One of those victims was pronounced dead at the scene, Richter said, and images showed a covered body in the street at the intersection of Woodbine and Vinton. The other victim was taken to hospital.  Moments later, another person was shot at the intersection of Motor and Vinton avenues. That victim remains in critical condition, but was expected to survive Lt. John Jenal said Thursday night.  Two other people were then shot at the intersection of Overland Avenue and National Boulevard and both were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not available, Richter said. According to news reports, the third location was outside a 7-Eleven store in a small shopping center.  Jenal said two of the shooting victims had been released from a hospital and were being interviewed by detectives at the LAPD Pacific Division.  Palms Middle School at 10860 Woodbine St. and Palms Elementary School at 3520 Motor Ave. were placed on precautionary temporary lockdown due to the shooting, according to Los Angeles school police.  Police went on tactical alert about 3:30 p.m. to allow for deployment of resources as needed. The alert was canceled about 7 p.m., police said.  Investigators were looking for a male suspect who was driving a white or silver SUV, Richter said.  It was unclear what prompted the gunfire or if it was believed to be gang-related.
