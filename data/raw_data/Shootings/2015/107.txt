CONYERS — One person is dead and three injured after a suspect opened fire in a Rockdale County liquor store and then went to a house in the 3500 block of Ebenezer Road where he shot two of the occupants, according to the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office.  Investigator Michael Camp said the suspect opened fire on a deputy who was called to the Ebenezer Road home with an assault rifle. The deputy fired back and shot the suspect, who has not been identified. The deputy was not injured, according to Camp, and the suspect’s condition was not immediately released.  Camp said the suspect went to the Magnet Bottle Shop at 4669 Ga. Highway 20 early in the afternoon Sunday where he became involved in an argument. The suspect returned shortly before 5 p.m. and began firing a gun. Camp said one person in the store was killed and another wounded. Camp said one of the victims was a store clerk and the other a customer, but it was not immediately known which one was killed.  The suspect then fled to a home on Ebenezer Road where two people were shot. When a deputy arrived at the house, one of the victims ran outside to safety and the suspect came out into the garage and began firing at the deputy.  Camp said the two shooting victims at the house were transported by air ambulance to Atlanta area hospitals. He said the investigation had not yet revealed the relationship between the two residents and the suspect.  Camp said the shooting at the liquor store is under investigation by the RCSO while the GBI has been called in to investigate the shooting at the Ebenezer Road residence.
