An Englewood shooting that left one person dead and five wounded early Sunday on the South Side also caused a crash that injured six other people, according to Chicago Police.  At 2:08 a.m., six people were outside in the 5700 block of South LaSalle when another group of people walked out of an alley and started shooting, police News Affairs Officer Ron Gaines said.  At least one person in the group of six returned fire, and a passing vehicle was caught in the crossfire, Gaines said. The driver lost control and it flipped over.  Charles Lewis, 28, was shot in the chest and taken to Saint Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center, where he was pronounced dead at 4:29 a.m., according to police and the Cook County medical examinerâ€™s office. His home address was not immediately known.  A 19-year-old woman whose face was grazed by a bullet was also taken to Saint Bernard, police said. She is listed in serious condition.  A 29-year-old woman shot in the face was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai Hospital, as was a 28-year-old woman who suffered a graze wound to the buttocks. Her condition stabilized, police said.  A 29-year-old man shot in the arm and leg was taken to Stroger Hospital along with a 23-year-old woman shot in the left foot. Their conditions also stabilized, police said.  Six women from the vehicle were taken to hospitals, with three in serious-to-critical condition, fire officials said. Two were taken to Stroger and one to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The other three were taken to Saint Bernard in good-to-fair condition.  A police source said the 29-year-old man who was wounded and taken to Stroger is a convicted felon with an extensive gang history, and may have been the intended target of the shooting.
