BOSTON (AP) — Police say one person was killed and three others injured when someone opened fire on a carload full of people in Boston.  The death on Thursday night was the city’s first homicide of the year.  Commissioner William Evans, who was at the scene, tells the Boston Herald the victims were shot as they sat in a car in the city’s Roxbury neighborhood.  The sedan sped away, but was spotted by police who stopped it several blocks away.  One of the men inside was pronounced dead at the scene. Two other men and a woman were hurt.  Evans says it appears as if the vehicle was targeted.  No names were released.  Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
