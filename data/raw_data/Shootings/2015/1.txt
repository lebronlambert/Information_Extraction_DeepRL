Police say an overnight shooting in Savannah left one man dead and sent four other people to a hospital early Friday. Two of the shooting victims are children.  Later in the afternoon, police said, a person of interest in the case surrendered to officers.  Detectives determined the 12:30 a.m. shooting at Allen Apartments on the 500 block of West 54th Street stemmed from a domestic situation, said Julian Miller, Savannah-Chatham police spokesman. Two male combatants arrived separately but within a short time span, said police spokeswoman Eunicia Baker.  She said it was reported shots were fired during an argument between the two men, both of whom had guns.  Randolph Scott, 28, died at the scene of the shooting. Transported to Memorial University Medical Center with what are believed to be non-life threatening wounds were a 2-year-old girl, an 8-year-old boy and two women, both 28, Miller said.
