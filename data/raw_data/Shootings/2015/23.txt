SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- A sixth victim of the shooting at McAvan's Pub early Sunday morning took herself to the hospital with a gunshot wound, police said.  The 35-year-old woman went to Crouse Hospital around 3 p.m. Sunday, Lt. Eric Carr said.  "She did speak with officers at the scene of the shooting but did not realize she was shot until the following day," Carr said. The woman, who suffered minor injuries, has been treated and released, Carr said.  The 35-year-old woman became the 6th victim in a shooting at the bar on West Fayette Street near Syracuse's Tipperary Hill neighborhood. Two victims remain in critical condition and two more are in serious condition after the shooting, police have said. Another person was released from the hospital Sunday.  Police have charged 22-year-old Michael Morris, of West Onondaga St. in connection with the shooting, which happened around 1 a.m. Sunday.  Morris, a parolee recently released from prison, kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint, then forced her to bring him to McAvan's, where her family was celebrating a birthday, police said. The victim's 24-year-old brother sensed something was wrong and attempted to split up Morris and his sister, police said.  The brother was the first victim to be shot. Two men who tried to remove Morris from the bar were also shot, police said. Another two bystanders were shot before Morris fled, police said.  Police found Morris at his home, 1613 W. Onondaga St. and arrested him without incident, Carr said. He was charged with five counts of second-degree attempted murder, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and first-degree reckless endangerment, all felonies. He has also been charged with misdemeanor second-degree menacing.  Carr said additional charges against Morris are forthcoming.  Were you at McAvan's during the shooting? We'd like to hear from you.
