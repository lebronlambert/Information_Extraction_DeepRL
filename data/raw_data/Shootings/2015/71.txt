WILLIAMSPORT -- Five people were shot early Saturday when a dispute that began inside a downtown Williamsport night club spilled outside.  The shooting, which occurred just after 2 a.m. outside Imbibe in the 300 block of Pine Street, sent two people to Geisinger Medical Center near Danville where they underwent surgery and three others to Williamsport Regional Medical Center.  City police did not release the name of the victims, both men and women. Their conditions also were not available.  It appears a group from Williamsport and one from Philadelphia argued inside the club, Assistant Chief Timothy Miller said. The shooting occurred as the club was emptying at closing time with at least some of those wounded being bystanders not involved in the dispute, he said.  The shooter was a male who is believed to have left the club, got a handgun from a vehicle, returned and opened fire, Miller said. Police have not ruled out there might have been more than one shooter, he said.  Witnesses have provided information that is expected to help in identifying the shooter, he said.
