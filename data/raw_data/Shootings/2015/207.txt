Four people were found shot at a home Saturday morning, three of them dead.  "It's a homicide investigation," said Roswell Police Public Information Officer Todd Wildermuth.  Two adult men and two adult women were found shot in a home on East Reed Street. Roswell police say three of them died from their injuries.  "We have one other victim that is still surviving and on her way to another hospital," said Wildermuth. "I don't know the specifics on her condition right now."  The victims were discovered around 8 a.m.  "Well the investigation is still in its early stages, initially we believe that the shooting occurred not too far before the call came in," said Wildermuth.  Roswell police say they do not have any suspects at this time. The victims have not yet been identified.  "They were all found either in or right around the residence," said Wildermuth. "The investigation will confirm different spots."  If you have any information about this crime you are urged to call the Roswell Police Department at 575- 624-6770.
