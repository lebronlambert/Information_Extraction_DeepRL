Anniston police are investigating an altercation Tuesday night that left four people seriously wounded.  Sgt. Chris Sparks said the incident happened about 6:30 p.m. in the Constantine Homes area, the second shooting there in four days' time. After police responded at the scene of the shooting, four shooting victims showed up at a local hospital.  Sparks said multiple males were apparently involved in a dispute that ended in gunfire.  "During the exchange, the four victims were struck in varying locations on their bodies," he said. "Additionally, a single vehicle was struck in the parking lot."  All of the victims are expected to survive.  Sparks said more information would be available later, as the investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact the department's investigative division at (256) 240-4000.
