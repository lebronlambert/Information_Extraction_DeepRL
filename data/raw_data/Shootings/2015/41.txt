Both are in serious condition.Inside his home, Branch was shot in the head and later died at a hospital, police said. Branch's great grandson, who was also inside the home, was grazed on the arm. The 5-year-old boy is expected to be okay."He's a Christian, he's retired, a pillar of the neighborhood. A good guy, always good guy, always trying to help. He's an older gentleman, you know, he's in his 70s. So, he's a good guy," said Angela Carter, victim's neighbor."He was an outstanding gentleman. Just a father, like you," said Maurice Hall, victim's friend.Relatives said Branch was a retired maintenance worker who was a deacon at his church and devoted to his family. He did not know the woman and the child shot outside his home, according to his relatives.Police said the shooting appears to have been gang-related, but they're not commenting on who was the intended target. Police said multiple persons of interest are in custody and being questioned.
