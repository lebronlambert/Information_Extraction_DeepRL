And when he sought revenge on Wednesday, gunning down two former colleagues, he used the tools of social media to ensure that his crime was broadcast live, recorded from multiple angles and posted online.          Vester Lee Flanagan II, 41, identified by the authorities as the gunman, waited until Alison Parker and Adam Ward, young journalists at WDBJ in Roanoke, were on air, then killed them while recording on his own video camera. Mr. Flanagan shot himself in the head hours later, the authorities said, but as the chase for him was on, he wrote about the shooting on Twitter, uploaded his video to Facebook and sent a manifesto to ABC News that spoke admiringly of mass killers and said that as a black, gay man he had faced discrimination and sexual harassment.  The shooting and the horrifying images it produced marked a new chapter in the intersection of video, violence and social media.  Photo  The day began with the most mundane of early-morning interviews. Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward were working on a story for WDBJ about the 50th anniversary of Smith Mountain Lake, a reservoir tucked among farms and rolling mountains that is popular with anglers, kayakers and sunbathers. They stood on a balcony of Bridgewater Plaza, a shopping and office complex on the lakeshore, talking with Vicki Gardner, executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce.  Around 6:45 a.m., the shooting began.  The station’s own disturbing video shows Ms. Parker screaming and stumbling backward as the shots ring out and a set of jumbled images as the camera falls to the floor. Eight shots can be heard before the broadcast cut back to the stunned anchor at the station, Kimberly McBroom.  Shortly afterward, Mr. Flanagan wrote on Twitter, “I filmed the shooting see Facebook,” and a shocking 56-second video recording, which appeared to be taken by a body camera worn by the gunman, was posted to his Facebook page. It showed him waiting until the journalists were on air before raising a handgun and firing at point-blank range, ensuring that it would be seen, live or recorded, by thousands.  Both social media accounts used the name he was known by on television, Bryce Williams, and both were shut down within hours of the shooting.  Ms. Parker, 24, a reporter, and Mr. Ward, 27, a cameraman, both white, were pronounced dead at the scene. Ms. Gardner was wounded and underwent emergency surgery, but was expected to survive. Mr. Flanagan shot and killed himself hours later after being cornered by the police on a highway about 200 miles away.  Photo  If the killings shocked the nation, they had particular resonance in this rural area where local reporters are recognized personalities. Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward were known as hardworking, cheerful people who had grown up here and were romantically involved with other members of their station’s staff. At a midday news conference, Bill Overton Jr., the Franklin County sheriff, said Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward had interviewed him about three weeks ago, and he was watching live on Wednesday when they were killed.

ABC reported that a man claiming to be Bryce Williams had contacted the network several times in recent weeks, saying he had a story for them. He never said what it was.  “Why did I do it?” Mr. Flanagan said in the rambling fax message, which The New York Times obtained from a law enforcement official. “I was already on the edge. The church shooting was a tipping point. The victims’ initials are written on the bullets.”  He echoed the words of the accused Charleston gunman, Dylann Roof, and spoke of a race war. He also said Jehovah had told him to act. He spoke admiringly of the Columbine High School killers and the gunman who carried out the Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead. At one point, he called his document a “Suicide Note for Friends and Family.”  The fax, which also contained allegations that he was repeatedly harassed, bullied and discriminated against for being black and gay, was turned over to law enforcement officials. On Twitter, he made similar charges of racism and harassment, adding that he had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency. A spokeswoman for the agency, Kimberly Smith-Brown, said federal law prohibited her from confirming whether the agency had received a complaint.  Photo  “This gentleman was disturbed at the way things had turned out at some point in his life,” Sheriff Overton said at the news conference. “Things were spiraling out of control.”  Accounts from former colleagues, competitors and court records indicate that Mr. Flanagan, who had graduated from San Francisco State University and worked in several markets around the South, was a skilled broadcaster, but also volatile, combative, threatening and prone to seeing himself as persecuted.  A video compilation of Mr. Flanagan’s reporting, of the kind reporters often make to show prospective employers, begins, chillingly, with him holding a gun. But at WDBJ, he typically did human-interest stories: a town with seven churches within a three-block area; firefighters handing out free smoke detectors; Huntfest, an annual hunting-products event at the Roanoke Civic Center; a local man turning 100.  He worked there for less than a year before he was fired in 2013. He later sued the station, claiming discrimination, but the case was dismissed after a judge found the controversy had been settled. Speaking on the air Wednesday, Jeffrey A. Marks, president and general manager of the station, confirmed that Mr. Flanagan had filed a complaint against the station, but said it was dismissed as baseless.

He did not take that well, and we had to call the police to escort him from the building.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Continue reading the main story Video  Mr. Flanagan seemed to have particular animus toward Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward. “Alison made racist comments,” he wrote on Twitter just after the shooting, an apparent reference to Ms. Parker. Two minutes later, apparently referring to Mr. Ward, he wrote, “Adam went to hr on me after working with me one time!!!”  Court filings in a civil lawsuit Mr. Flanagan brought against the station documented his many confrontations. In a May 31, 2012, memo, Dan Dennison, a WDBJ executive, wrote that Mr. Flanagan had, on three occasions, “behaved in a manner that has resulted in one or more of your co-workers feeling threatened or uncomfortable.”  In another memo two months later, Mr. Dennison ordered Mr. Flanagan to seek help through the company’s employee assistance program, and stated that he engaged “in behaviors that constitute creation of a hostile work environment.”  In a 2000 lawsuit, Mr. Flanagan also claimed to have been subjected to racial slurs at another station where he had worked, WTWC in Tallahassee, Fla., where he was also let go. In a court filing, the station cited among other reasons, “misbehavior with regards to co-workers,” and the case was settled on undisclosed terms.  “He was a good on-air performer, pretty good reporter, and then things started getting a little strange with him,” Don Shafer, who worked with Mr. Flanagan at WTWC, said in a broadcast on the station where he now works in San Diego. He said that Mr. Flanagan’s contract had been terminated, in part, because of bizarre behavior and threats to other employees.  “He turned around and sued us,” Mr. Shafer said. “He wanted to sue us for something else, he ended up suing us for racial discrimination.”  Continue reading the main story PENNSYLVANIA 95 WEST VIRGINIA DEL. MD. 81 VIRGINIA Richmond Moneta Roanoke N.C. 100 Miles  Adam Henning, the news director at WAFF, a television station in Huntsville, Ala., said Mr. Flanagan sought a job there in 2011, but was rejected after Mr. Henning contacted a half-dozen references. They told him that Mr. Flanagan “was exceedingly difficult to work with,” he said, and had once gotten into “a physical altercation” at a company Christmas party.  After the shootings on Wednesday, Mr. Flanagan left the scene in a rented car; his own car was parked at the Roanoke airport, Sheriff Overton said. Officials said the police pursued him going north on Interstate 81, but did not attempt to catch him, knowing that he was armed; it is not clear whether they lost track of him. After he turned east on Interstate 66, heading toward Washington, a state trooper spotted the car using a license plate reader, and after being joined by other units, the troopers turned on their lights and tried to pull him over, around 11:30 a.m.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “He refused to stop and sped away,” said Sgt. Rick Garletts of the State Police. A minute or two later, “the vehicle ran off the road and into the median.”  Mr. Flanagan was found with a gunshot wound to the head and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead two hours later.  At the stunned television station, co-workers mourned their slain colleagues. Mr. Ward was engaged to Melissa Ott, a producer at WDBJ. His Facebook page shows pictures of the two of them on vacation in Las Vegas and, most recently this summer, Atlantic City.  Members of the station staff said Ms. Ott was at the station, watching the broadcast when the shooting happened. They said it was to be her last day at the station before she moved to Charlotte, N.C., for another job, and that Mr. Ward was looking for work there, too.  Mr. Ward began working for WDBJ as an intern while still in college, and Mike Stevens, a former longtime sports director at the station, called him “the most enthusiastic intern that I ever had in 23 years of mentoring kids in that department.”  Ms. Parker, a graduate of James Madison University, had been dating Chris Hurst, a WDBJ anchor. “She was the most radiant woman I ever met,” Mr. Hurst wrote on Twitter. “And for some reason she loved me back.”  “She was everything you wanted a reporter to be: tough but fair, with lots of ideas,” said Brad Jenkins, the general manager of The Breeze, the James Madison student newspaper. “We’re stunned.”  Ryan Parkhurst, a faculty member in the university’s School of Media Arts and Design, said he had taught Ms. Parker in three classes and mentored her for four years. “I’m devastated because I remember the amazing person, and that she won’t be going after these stories,” he said.
