Teen killed in New Orleans shooting Photos Related Photos  The teen was among four people shot around 2:15 p.m. in the 2100 block of Governor Nicholls Street in Tremé. A 15-year-old boy, 19-year-old man and a 21-year-old man were also shot. They were treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, police said.  Detectives are looking for a red Nissan Versa with dark-tinted windows. The car is missing the housing on one of its side mirrors, most likely the passenger’s side, police said. The car has an unknown, out-of-state license plate.  Another person was shot around the same time near the intersection of Laharpe and North Roman streets in the Seventh Ward, police said. A 29-year-old man suffered non-life-threatening injuries.  Detectives are trying to determine if the shootings are related.  "The calls came out separately," Cmdr. O.L. Sandifer said. "So we haven't determined whether or not they are related."  Sandifer said the four people found shot on Governor Nicholls Street told investigators a small red car drove up to them and someone inside opened fire on the group of males who were on foot. The car then sped away.  Anyone with information on a crime can call Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111.  Sign up for our email newsletters to get breaking news right in your inbox.
