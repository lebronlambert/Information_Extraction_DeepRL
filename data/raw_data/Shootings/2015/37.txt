Sept. 5, 1949: World War II veteran Howard Unruh, 28, shot and killed 13 neighbors in Camden, N.J. He was committed to a state mental institution.  A man suspected in the shooting deaths of two people and the wounding of a third near Columbia, Missouri, was killed in an exchange of gunfire with a Boone County sheriff's deputy Saturday night, a county detective said.  The Columbia Missourian reported the initial shooting occurred in the 4400 block of Santa Anna Drive, just east of Columbia. The confrontation between the suspected shooter and the deputy took place at the intersection of Broadway and U.S. 63, Sheriff's Department Detective Tom O'Sullivan said.  "Our deputy killed the suspect," the newspaper quoted O'Sullivan as saying.  Investigators had not released the names of the gunman and victims or disclosed a possible motive for the initial shooting. The condition of the surviving shooting victim was not available.  The Columbia Daily Tribune reported the Sheriff's Department received word of a shooting shortly after 10 p.m. and witnesses said the alleged shooter had left in a white, four-door vehicle. The newspaper reported O'Sullivan said the Missouri State Highway Patrol is investigating the officer-involved shooting, and the Sheriff's Department is investigating the initial shooting. O'Sullivan said the department wasn't yet releasing the name of the deputy who shot the suspect.
