The officers were not involved or engaged with any of the residents of the household.”  O’Shea says the suspect’s 59-year-old mother was taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds.  A 60-year-old man was killed in the home. O’Shea did not disclose his relationship with the shooter. Neighbors say the man may have been a counselor or therapist brought in to help him.
