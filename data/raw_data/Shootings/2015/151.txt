FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) – The Fort Wayne Police Department is investigating a shooting that left nine people injured on the city’s southeast side.  Police were responding to a disturbance around 1:15 a.m. Sunday morning in the 1400 block of McCulloch Street, several blocks south of Indiana Tech University.  As officers were enroute, they received information that multiple people were shot, according to FWPD Officer Chris Felton. Six victims were located in the area suffering from apparent gunshot wounds.  One woman was taken to a local hospital in critical condition, but she was later upgraded to serious condition. Five others were hospitalized in good condition.  Police said three additional victims arrived at a hospital a short time later. Two were reported in good condition, but a man was listed in critical condition.  Felton said it appears there was a party at a home in the area, but some type of altercation led to the shooting. However, police still are unclear what exactly prompted the incident.  Police are interviewing potential witnesses and gathered evidence at the crime scene. No weapons were recovered at the scene and police have not said what type of weapon might have been used in the shooting. Investigators said they have no suspects and no one has been arrested.  Felton said it’s unclear if the incident is gang-related or if anyone was a specific target.
