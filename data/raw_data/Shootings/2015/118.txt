Images: Quadruple shooting in Evanston  Investigators believe the four men were shot in a gun battle with each other. They do not believe any other shooters are at large.  Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said he is not happy that a fatal shooting happened on the same day that his crime-reduction plan was put into action.  "(There are) three or four people shot in broad daylight with children playing outside. It's disturbing. It's very disappointing, and it will not be tolerated," Blackwell said.  Police said they did recover a gun at the scene.  Blackwell said the homicide investigators had to be called back in hours after they got off the clock after investigating an officer-involved shooting in Northside Tuesday night.  The shooting victim was identified as Nake'land Williams, 18. The identities of the others involved have not been released.
