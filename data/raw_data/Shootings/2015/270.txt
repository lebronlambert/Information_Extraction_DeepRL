It happened in the 6100 block of Mt. Moriah Road near the parking lot of Peachtree Center shopping complex.  Outside the Deseo Bar and Grill, police found a crowd who reported hearing gunshots.  Witnesses told police the shots were fired between individuals in a mid-2000 gray Chevy Impala or a Nissan Maxima and a white Pontiac GS.  The owner of the bar did not want WREG to identify her but said the trouble began outside a business further down the complex. Several businesses have bullet holes or shattered glass, which she said suggested someone ran toward her bar after the gunfire already began.  "Like the police said, we are a victim. Those people were not in my club," the owner said.  Police released surveillance images, showing men standing outside a closed business further down the complex. Police said the violence stemmed from rival gangs and a dice game gone wrong.  Four of the victims were transported to Regional Medical Center in critical condition but have been stabilized and sent home.  The fifth victim was transported to Methodist South Hospital and released. The sixth was transported to St. Francis Hospital and is now in critical condition.  At this time, no arrests have been made.  The bar's owner said she wants more security for the complex's parking lot. WREG reached out to a man we believe to be an owner of the shopping center but have not yet heard back.  Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 528-CASH.
