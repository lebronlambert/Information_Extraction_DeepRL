GRANITE CITY — Investigators believe the man killed in a single-vehicle accident Sunday had been shot and may have been coming from the scene of a multi-victim shooting.  Lonnie Christopher Roberson, 38, of St. Louis, was a passenger in a car that had been traveling at a high rate of speed northbound on Madison Avenue near 15th Street when it left the roadway, striking multiple utility poles and flipping over. Granite City Police responded to the scene at 1:24 a.m., and Roberson was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter.  The driver, whose name was not released by authorities, was transported to a St. Louis-area hospital, where he is listed in serious condition.  According to a statement from the Madison County Coroner’s Office, investigators believe Roberson was being driven to Gateway Regional Hospital after having sustained a gunshot wound in a multi-victim shooting at L.T.’s Lounge, a club in Venice. At least six people were injured, according to the coroner, none of them seriously. The shooting is being investigated by the Venice Police Department.  The autopsy on Roberson indicated he had been shot in the right knee, but that wound was not the cause of his death. Instead, he was killed due to blunt force injuries sustained in the crash, according to the coroner’s statement.  Detective Brandon Shellenberg said Venice police responded to the scene at 1:30 a.m. and found that six people had been shot in a crowd of more than 100 patrons. Some of the victims were hospitalized overnight, but none had life-threatening injuries, he said.  Shellenberg said the investigation is ongoing, and being coordinated among the Venice and Granite City police departments and the Illinois State Police. He could not release further information while the investigation was ongoing, he said.  Funeral arrangements for Roberson are pending.
