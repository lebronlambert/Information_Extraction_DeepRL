DURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) – Eight people were injured in a drive-by shooting incident in Durham Friday night.  No one was killed but one person among the seven men and one women who were injured is in serious condition following the shooting in the 2700 block of Hinson Drive just before 10:30 p.m., authorities said.  All of the victims were taken to the hospital for treatment.  Witnesses told police that they saw four gun barrels pointing out of the car with multiple people shooting.  Police said the victims were at a cookout at a private home, but have not said if the victims are related.  Mary Veney has lived on the street for years. She said the incident was “upsetting.”  “From what I understand it was a drive by and there are a lot of kids in this neighborhood. And you would hate to see any of them hurt because grown people don’t know how to handle their own affairs,” Veney said.  The victims were shot in various places including the foot, leg, calf and chest, police said.  No arrests have been made and there are currently no suspects.  No other information was immediately available.  Anyone with information is asked to call CrimeStoppers at (919) 683-1200.
