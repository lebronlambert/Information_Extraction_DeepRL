Police were looking Tuesday for a gunman who fired on a group of people in Long Beach, wounding four in a possibly gang-related shooting.  When officers responded about 10:25 p.m. Monday to a report of a shooting in the 1600 block of East 10th Street, they found a woman, a teenage boy and two men injured, Long Beach police Sgt. Megan Zabel said. The gunman fled before police arrived.  Police were still trying to determine why the four victims, all of Long Beach, were at the location.  Zabel said gunfire struck a 17-year-old boy, a 20-year-old woman, a 25-year-old man and a 31-year-old man. They were all taken to a hospital.  On Tuesday, Zabel said the four were in stable condition.  The shooting may be tied to gang activity, and gang detectives are investigating, she said.
