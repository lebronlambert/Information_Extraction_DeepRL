A gunman shot eight people and killed one early Sunday morning after a sprawling music festival in California that featured Waka Flocka Flame, Tech N9ne and dozens of other performers, Modesto police said Sunday.  The shooting occurred outside a warehouse a few miles from the festival, in an industrial section of Modesto, the police said in a release.  "While attendees were waiting to get into the party, a black male adult walked into the parking lot and started shooting." police said.  The gunman was not identified, and it was unclear why he opened fire.  Zachary McGee, 25, died at the hospital, the release said. Two unidentified victims — a 23-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man — remained in critical and serious but stable condition, while five others were treated and released.  The concert, called the X Fest, bills itself as the "biggest party" in California's Central Valley. This was its 15th year, and its lineup included 120 bands on 13 stages across 15 city blocks, drawing 20,000 people, according to the festival's Facebook page.  Festival promoter Chris Ricci told NBC News the party was an "unsanctioned" and "unpermitted" event, and that it was not officially connected to X Fest.  "Some people that attended the event attended the party," he said. "It's horrible and it's sad, but this definitely had nothing to do with X Fest."
