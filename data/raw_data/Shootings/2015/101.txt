One was struck in the buttocks and the other in both legs.The 47-year-old victim was also shot in his buttocks.The name of the victim who was killed is being withheld. But police say he was a reputed drug lord well known to them.This was the Chester's seventh homicide of the year - all drug underworld related, police sources say.Police say murders like this aren't just becoming more common, they're becoming a sick source of pride for some.A new trend is emerging, police say, in which assassins put pictures of their kills on t-shirts, then proudly post a picture of themselves on Facebook wearing the t-shirt... but never saying "I did it."So far, there is no word on any suspects or motive in this case.
