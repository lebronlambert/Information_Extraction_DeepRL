ORIGINAL STORY:  A 14-year-old boy is dead after an early morning shooting.  It happened just before 2:00 in the 2400 block of North Flora.  Police say they found Tommie Forest unresponsive behind a house after receiving several shot spotter alerts. There were also several calls from neighbors reporting gun shots.  Police say there appears to have been a home invasion, in which multiple shots were fired. It's unclear whether or not Forest was inside the home at the time of the shooting.  Forest was a freshman at Peoria High School, where he also played football.  The Peoria County Corners' office says an autopsy is scheduled for Saturday afternoon. Three other PHS students were injured. Two of them also play football at the high school.  Police are continuing their investigation of the incident.
