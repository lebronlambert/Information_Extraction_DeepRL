Police say a group of people had gathered for a party at 58th and LaSalle, many spilling out into the street and down the block, when witnesses say another group of people emerged from an alley and started shooting.  At least six people were shot and the driver of a passing SUV, getting caught in the crossfire, lost control flipping the vehicle onto its side. Six people involved in the rollover were rushed area hospitals.  Neighbors say it sounded like a war zone.  Police taped off 4 separate crime scenes. One where the party started, another in an alley, a third at 57th and Wentworth and the final one where the overturned vehicle came to rest -- leaving behind shattered glass and items from inside scattered on the ground.  A 28-year-old man was shot in the chest and later pronounced dead at St. Bernard Hospital. A medical examiner identified the victim as Charles Lewis of the 5700 block of Wentworth.
