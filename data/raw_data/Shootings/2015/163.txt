THREE ADULTS HAVE ALSO BEEN INJURED AND SHOOTING HAPPENING ON WEST FIELD AND MEMORIAL STREET ON DETROIT'S WEST SIDE. LOCAL FOUR KIMBERLY GILL WAS FIRST ON THE SCENE AND LIVE RIGHT NOW. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED, KIMBERLY? POLICE ARE CALLING THIS A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AND JUST SO SAD THAT A CHILD HAD TO GET HURT IN ALL OF THIS FOOLISHNESS. TAKE A LOOK BEHIND ME, THIS IS ACTIVE CRIME SCENE AND CRIME SCENE SERVICES UNIT HAS ARRIVED ON SCENE AND POLICE HAVE BEEN GOING AROUND WITH FLASHLIGHTS AND YOU COULD SEE THE MARKERS WHERE MARKETING BULLET CASINGS AND AT LEAST INVENT OF THEM THERE AND GOOD NEWS IN ALL OF THIS, EVERYBODY THAT'S SHOT GOING TO BE OKAY, INCLUDING ONE-YEAR-OLD CHILD BUT THE SEARCH CONTINUES TONIGHT FOR THE TWO PEOPLE WHO POLICE SAY IT HAPPENED ABOUT 8:00 ON WEST SIDE. SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE NEAR CORNER OF MEMORIAL AND WEST FIELD STREETS WHEN A CAR DROVE BY AND STARTED SHOOTING. FOUR MALES ON A PORCH, LOOKS LIKE ENGAGED IN DICE GAME AND CAR CAME BY GRAY VEHICLE, SMALLER VEHICLE AND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS OCCUPIED BY TWO MALES, TWO BLACK MALES. A TOTAL OF FOUR PEOPLE WERE HIT, INCLUDING A CHILD. QUESTIONS TO NEIGHBORS TO GET MORE CLUES AND MOST PART PEOPLE ARE COOPERATING WITH POLICE. NEVER EASY WHEN A CHILD IS INJURED. NEVER EASY WHEN ANYONE IS INJURED AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOUNG CHILD IS INJURED AND PROVIDE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET.
