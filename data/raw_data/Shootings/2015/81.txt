Officers said about 100 people were partying at the residence near the intersection of McArthur Avenue and Germantown Street around 4 a.m. Sunday when shots rang out.  Police said some victims were found at the scene, while others drove themselves to Miami Valley Hospital.  WHIO-TV reported one person was pronounced dead at the scene.  Another person was found shot in the leg about a block away from the residence. They are investigating if those injuries are also related to the party.  A dispatch supervisor told WLWT News 5 that as far as police know now, only one gunman was involved.  Police are still interviewing witnesses.
