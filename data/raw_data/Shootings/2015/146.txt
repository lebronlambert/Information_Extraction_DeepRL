NEWARK â€” Five people were shot Wednesday night, including three left in critical condition.  One of those victims, a man in his mid-20s, died around 8 a.m. Thursday morning, according to Kathy Carter, a spokesperson for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Carter did not immediately release the name of the slain victim.  The shooting occurred around 10:45 p.m. on Brunswick Street, which was cordoned off between Astor and Wright streets as officers conducted an investigation Wednesday night.  Four people who live on Astor, Wright and other surrounding streets heard what they mistook for fireworks and were unaware of the incident until several police units responded, those people said.
