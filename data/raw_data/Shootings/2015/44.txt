3 dead, 1 critical in apparent south AL 'murder-suicide' Posted: Monday, March 16, 2015 11:49 AM EDT Updated: Wednesday, April 15, 2015 11:49 AM EDT  The Houston County Sheriff's Office released more details in connection to the investigation of a multi-fatal weekend shooting that involved four people. Three, including the gunman, were confirmed dead in what authorities described as a murder-suicide.  Sheriff Donald Valenza says the shootings happened Sunday night at a residence on Zachary Road near Cottonwood. Officers responded to a burglary in progress call at 10:42 p.m. and were on the scene within four minutes. When officers arrived, they found a gruesome scene, three people dead and a fourth fighting for life.  Investigators say a man they'd been looking for all weekend shot the victims before turning the gun on himself. That man was identified as 45-year-old Christopher Lance Joyner.  Authorities say Joyner, whom court records indicate was a fugitive after his bond was revoked Thursday, apparently went to the home, forced his way inside and then opened fire. The suspect's wife, Mary Alice Joyner, 43, and Jeffery Brett Swisher, a family friend, were killed in the gunfire. A third victim, 74-year-old Alice Carole Swisher was critically wounded but is still alive, according to investigators.  Following the shooting of his wife and family friends, Joyner apparently turned the weapon on himself, taking his own life.  Investigators were familiar with the gunman. Sheriff Valenza confirmed that a warrant was active for Joyner in regards to an ongoing domestic situation. Court documents indicate Joyner's bond was revoked because of a violation of a family violence protection order.  The sheriff says the investigation indicates the shooting may have been domestic in nature between the Joyners. The Swishers were unrelated victims, he added.  The investigation is ongoing.
