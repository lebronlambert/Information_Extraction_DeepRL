Police discovered the shooting took place at a building in the 1800 block of North Kingston, where an after-hours party was taking place. Three more gunshot victims also were taken to area hospitals.  Officers interviewed more than 20 witnesses at the party, including three security guards who had been armed, according to police. Three handguns were recovered from the guards. Several shell casings, apparently fired from multiple weapons, were found in the street in front of the building.  Police believe the shooting started after an altercation broke out at the party. At least one shot was fired inside the building, moving the crowd outside, police said. Security followed the assailant — or assailants — outside and exchanged gunfire.  Four people were shot, at least one in critical condition. The conditions of the other three are unknown. It is unclear whether the victims were the shooters or bystanders, but no security guards were struck, police said.  Officers are waiting on a search warrant.
