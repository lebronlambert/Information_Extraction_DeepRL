Four people, including a child, were taken to a nearby hospitals after the shooting incident at the Austin Oaks apartments off of Glenwood Avenue in Decatur.  Police are investigating a shooting Monday that has injured four people, including a 1-year-old.  The child was in critical condition and is now recovering from surgery and expected to be OK.  The grandmother of D'onte' Patterson II didn't have much time to speak with Channel 2’s Richard Elliot as she was rushing to get to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.  She seemed to say she knew two of the people who were shot.  “I don't know if either of them is OK,” the grandmother said, not identifying herself.    The shooting happened at the Austin Oaks Apartments just after 8 p.m.    According to DeKalb County police detectives, a group of people, including the toddler, was standing out in the breezeway when someone came around a corner and just started shooting.    They still don't know why.    Joseph Mason heard the shots from inside his apartment.    “Constant. Pow, pow. Like automatic going off, like they shot seven or eight times,” Mason told Elliot.  A child appears to be the most seriously wounded. 3 others are being treated for non-life threatening wounds. #wsbtvpic.twitter.com/PBoIkGi4tJ — Richard Elliot (@RElliotWSB) October 13, 2015  DeKalb police only have a vague description of the suspect and aren't sure how he made his getaway, but they are vowing to find the man who fired into a crowd of people that included a small child.    “This is a serious issue when you have an individual who is willing to take a shot and hit and shoot indiscriminately into a group of people and hit a child. That is something that the DeKalb police is really not going to tolerate,” said Detective Corneilus Yarbro with the DeKalb County Police Department.  Two men and a woman were taken to a local hospital with non life-threatening injuries.
