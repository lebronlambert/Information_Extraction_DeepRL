Authorities are searching for a man who shot four people at a house party near Bethune-Cookman University early Friday morning, according to the Daytona Beach Police Department.  Vincent Tyrone Smith, 23, shot the victims at a home on Henry Butts Drive, which is two blocks south of the university, police said.  Investigators believe the shooting was in retaliation for Smith being kicked out of a party at the same house about a month ago.  A neighbor told WESH 2 he heard eight gunshots and that one bullet hit his house.  “I was getting ready to come to the party, but when I heard that gunshot, I was like ‘Nu uh, no I don’t want to die. I’m trying to live,’ so I just stayed right there and told everybody else, ‘Man, we’re not going nowhere. Let’s stay at the house,’” neighbor Raymond Wallace said.  Wallace also said that students live in the house and are always throwing parties.  Two of the victims suffered injuries to their sides, and two others were shot in their hands. They were all taken to Halifax Hospital and are expected to survive.  Three of the victims are listed as students at Bethune-Cookman University.  Police said Smith, who is affiliated with a gang, has a tattoo on his left shoulder that says "Love of my life," and is believed to be traveling in an orange 2011 Chevy Camaro with the Florida tag DGKD87 or temporary Florida tag BFJ3044.  Smith is armed and dangerous, police said. He is facing aggravated battery and assault charges.  Police said they received a tip about Smith's possible whereabouts somewhere in Brevard County Friday afternoon, but he has not been located.
