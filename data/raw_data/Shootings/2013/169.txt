Four people have been killed and six others injured in a drive-by shooting in Puerto Rico.  Police said in a statement Saturday that a 45-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter are among the victims. Police say they were part of a group gathered at a barbecue restaurant in the central mountain town of Aguas Buenas late Friday when unknown gunmen began shooting into the crowd.  Police say one of the injured people is in critical condition.  No one has been arrested, and police say they don't yet have a motive.  The U.S. territory of nearly 4 million people reported a record 1,117 homicides in 2011.
