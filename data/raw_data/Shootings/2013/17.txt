TULSA - Tulsa police have identified the victims in Monday's five homicides in south and east Tulsa.  Around 12:30 Monday afternoon police were called to Fairmont Terrace near 58th and Peoria. Upon arrival officers found four women shot to death in an apartment and a 3-year-old child unharmed.  Police have identified the women as Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, both 23, Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55.  Powell and Melchor were twins. Their father spoke to 2NEWS Monday and said, "My life's gone. My kids are gone."  No one has come forward with any information but homicide detectives are currently interviewing potential witnesses.  "I think whoever did this should be a man and redeem themselves," said Kayetie's brother-in-law, Jeffrey Melchor. "You have got to say you did it, be a man and don't hide."  At this point in the investigation detectives do not believe this was a random killing.  Eight hours after the women were found dead, a 50-year-old man was found shot at Garden Courtyards Apartments near 43rd and Garnett. He later died at a Tulsa hospital.  Police say the man, identified as 52-year-old Christopher Odis Williams, was shot walking into his sister's apartment.  Police say Williams appeared to have all his belongings so robbery may not have been the motive.  Monday's string of homicides brings the toll to seven for the year.
