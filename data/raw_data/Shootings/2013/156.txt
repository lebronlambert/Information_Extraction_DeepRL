OBERLIN, Ohio â€” A suspect is in custody after four people were injured late Thursday night from a shooting in the parking lot of an apartment complex, a police official said.  None of the injuries were life-threatening and all the victims were treated and released at a local hospital, said Lt. Michael McCloskey.  McCloskey did not release the names of the victims -- ages 17, 22, 23 and 26 -- pending notification of family members. He also did not release the name of the 24-year-old suspect, who currently is being held in the city's jail while awaiting charges.  McCloskey said the suspect was arrested without incident at his residence near the location of the shooting. He said a 9 mm handgun and eight spent shell casings were recovered.  "The initial investigation seems to indicate that this incident might have been part of some escalating dispute between the shooter and at least one of the victims," McCloskey said.  A witness told the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram the shooting occurred after the four victims confronted the suspect. One victim accused the suspect of making derogatory remarks about a relative, the witness said.  WKYC Channel 3 reports the four victims were taken to Mercy Allen Hospital. One has already been released. According to police, a bullet grazed the head of the 22-year-old, the 17-year-old and the 23-year-old were struck in the lower extremities, and the 26-year-old was wounded in the arm.
