Police vehicles at the scene of a suburban Houston shooting early Sunday Nov. 10, 2013  In the US, another deadly shooting incident kills at least two people and injures 22 others at a house party packed with teenagers and young adults in Houston, Texas. Authorities say the incident happened at a home in the Cypress area of Houston's suburbs when two gunmen opened fire on partygoers. Police say more than 100 people had gathered in the house at the time of the shooting to celebrate a young woman’s 18th birthday. The victims are said to be one man and one woman. Officials have so far refused to release their identities. Some of those injured are in critical condition. The shooting caused dozens of people to flee with some breaking the second-floor windows in order to jump out of the house. There is no word yet on a possible motive for the shooting. Harris County Sheriff's Office has issued a statement saying two suspects were being sought early Sunday. “It was a pretty chaotic scene,” said Thomas Gilliland, a spokesman with the sheriff's office adding that the wounded suffered shots to the foot, ankle and hip. More than 30,000 people have died by guns across the US since December last year, according to Slate.com, a website which tracks down the number of gun-related deaths in the country. DT/DT
