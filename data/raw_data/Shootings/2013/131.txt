Detectives are trying to find out why two young men were shot.  They were hit outside an apartment in Merced.  Two more were hurt when they jumped through a window so they wouldn't be shot.  All four were rushed to the hospital, where the two gunshot victims are listed in serious but stable condition.  Detectives do not believe the shooting to be gang-related.  If you have any information, call Detective Chris Russell at 1-209-385-4707.  {}
