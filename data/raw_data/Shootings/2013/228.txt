They are just two victims of two unrelated shootings.  Police say, a 19-year-old was shot and killed over a dice game on Brewer Avenue.  “Someone was playing with crooked dice and took all the money. They wanted their money back. Instead of giving the money back, he went to the car and got a gun,” said neighbor Jasmine Hervery.  Three others were shot when the argument turned into gunfire.  They were rushed to The MED, but expected to be OK.  “It was a whole bunch of shots. Like maybe 12 or 13,” said Hervery.  Jasmine Hervery was inside her home with her three children, all under the age of two.  They started crying.  “What did you think?” asked News Channel 3.  “Run and get in the room. Hoping no stray bullets come in and kill one of us,” said Hervery.  Jasmine thought fast to calm down her screaming kids.  “I just told them it’s fireworks. I don`t want them to have that in their head,” said Hervery.  Another shooting happened just 20 minutes earlier on the other side of town.  Police say on Laird in Hickory Hill, someone in a Black Honda pulled up in front of a home and fired a gun at a 20-year-old and a 17-year-old.  The 17-year-old is in critical condition.  While trying to speak with neighbors on Laird, an angry neighbor begged us not to report the shooting.  The neighbor says there had never been a shooting in the 20 years she lived on the street.  Jasmine says, there`s too much crime all over the city.  She's thinking about moving out of Memphis to keep her kids safe.  “They are kids, they don't deserve this, they are innocent. They don't deserve to hear gunshots,” expressed Hervery.  No arrests have been in either shooting.  Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 528-CASH.
