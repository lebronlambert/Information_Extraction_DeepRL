Salinas police arrested a man Monday in connection with a shooting at a taco shop that left two people dead and five hurt.  Police arrested Giovanni Pacheco, according to the Salinas Californian. He was booked on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, the paper reported.  The shooting took place Sunday at Taco's Choice restaurant, according to the Associated Press.  Arriving officers found a 22-year-old man dead of gunshot wounds. A 28-year-old man who also was shot several times was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  Salinas police Cmdr. Dave Shaw said the shooting occurred after two groups in the restaurant started brawling.  The conflict moved out to a parking lot, where it grew into "a pretty decent-sized fight" before someone pulled a handgun and began firing into the crowd, Shaw said. A 25-year-old man was critically wounded. Four other victims, including a 53-year-old woman who was shot multiple times, were expected to survive.  Detectives were gathering surveillance videos from neighboring businesses and interviewing witnesses.
