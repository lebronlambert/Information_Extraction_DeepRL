HARRISBURG - Harrisburg police are investigating a shooting outside a city community center that sent multiple people to the hospital this weekend.  It happened just after midnight Sunday near the intersection of North 16th and Walnut streets. Officers responded for a report of one person shot, but when they arrived, they were directed to the area of Walnut and Hoerner streets for a report of shots fired.  At that time, police dispatchers began taking reports that multiple people began arriving at local hospitals with non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Detectives later determined that a fight began at a youth party inside the Allison Hill Community Center, and as kids were leaving the building, someone began shooting into the crowd.  All victims have since been treated and released, according to police.  Investigators have not named any suspects. They urge anyone with information to call 558-6900 and ask for a city detective.
