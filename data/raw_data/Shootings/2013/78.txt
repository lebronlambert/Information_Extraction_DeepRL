BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - A 5-year-old Jefferson County boy shot Wednesday alongside his mother and little sister remains in critical condition today.  Jefferson County sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said Davieon Menefee is critical but stable. His 30-year-old mother and 3-year-old sister were killed in the shooting. Investigators believe all three were shot in the early evening on Tuesday, sometime after 5 p.m. The were discovered about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.  "That means this little boy was there overnight fighting to survive,'' Christian said. "He is going to have a great deal of healing to do and not just physically. He has shown us he is a fighter already and we are all pulling for him with a lot of prayer."  The trio was discovered shot inside their apartment late Wednesday morning. Davieon was airlifted to Children's Hospital.  Though friends and family had already identified the victims, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office today confirmed those identities. Killed in the shooting were Tiffany Bozeman, 30 and Gabrielle Menefee, 3. The shootings happened inside their second-floor apartment at The Park at Rocky Ridge apartment complex in southern Jefferson County.  Earlier Wednesday, Brandon Menefee - Bozeman's estranged boyfriend and the father of their two children - was found dead in Fairfield inside his car on Valley Road. An officer on routine patrol discovered Menefee's body when he stopped to see why the car was on the side of the roadway.  Police there suspected suicide early on. They had no idea, however, what would unfold just hours later when the other victims were discovered at The Park.  Christian said today investigators are waiting on the medical examiner's report and ballistics report to confirm what they already believe, which is murder-suicide. As for a motive, nothing is confirmed but, "At least one person reported the father was having a hard time dealing with them being estranged,'' he said.  The gun found in Menefee's Chevy Impala was the same caliber as shell casings found at the murder scene, Christian said.              Follow @alcombirmingham
