POMPANO BEACH — Christopher Singleton said he and three friends agreed to play one more game of dominoes before calling it a night when men — masked and armed — appeared out of the darkness.  "One of them said, 'Yeah, yeah, give it up,'" said Singleton, 25. "We looked at each other, like we were trying to decide if this was a joke. Then they just started shooting."  Those shots just before 1 a.m. Sunday claimed the life of Joshua Childs, 23, right there at the domino table in the driveway of a house at 1600 NW Seventh Lane, according to Broward Sheriff's Office deputies.  The three other players scrambled for safety.  Hit three times — in the right shoulder, left forearm and left hip — Singleton said he ran through the open garage and into the house and hid in a closet.  Bandaged and still wearing his hospital garb on Sunday afternoon, Singleton said he was lucky to be alive.  "This was a friendly game, and we have never had a problem," said Singleton who lives in the Canal Pointe neighborhood barely 100 yards from the scene of the shooting. "It happened so fast."  Singleton said he was released from the hospital after doctors removed a .45-caliber slug from his left arm and turned it over to police.  Also wounded was Alphonso Wright, 54, who lives at the house where domino games occur frequently, said Singleton.  Wright and Singleton were taken by Fire Rescue to Broward Health North, according to BSO.
