TRENTON - A shooting in front of a South Ward convenience store last night left a 24-year-old city man dead and four people wounded, the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said.  The shooting happened directly in front of the Community Food Market at the intersection of Jersey Street and Home Avenue, Mercer First Assistant Prosecutor Angelo Onofri said this morning.  Just before 10 p.m., a vehicle traveling on Home Avenue stopped directly in front of the store, a prosecutor's office spokeswoman said. Multiple shots emanated from the vehicle, cutting down Centre Street resident Brandon Varlow, three men and a woman. The car then fled the scene.  Varlow was shot multiple times, the prosecutor's office said. He was rushed to Capital Health Regional Medical Center but pronounced dead there last night.  The people shot alongside Varlow - men 24, 25, and 43 years old and a 25-year-old woman - were taken to area hospitals but all expected to survive, the prosecutor's office said.  The Mercer County Homicide Task Force is investigating. Anyone with information should call (609) 989-6406 or the Trenton police confidential tip line at (609) 989-3663.
