A man was arrested Monday, Nov. 4, in connection with a drive-by shooting that injured several people outside a restaurant and nightclub in Perris early Sunday, authorities said.Jose Luis Avalos, 36, was arrested at Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar and booked on suspicion of four counts of assault with a deadly weapon, jail records show. His bail was set at $25,000.The shooting was reported as the business was closing shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday in the 2900 block of Perris Boulevard, a Riverside County Sheriff's Department news release said. A large group of patrons were leaving when someone in a light-colored, four-door compact car drove by and opened fire, Sgt. Ryan Hoxmeier said.A security guard returned fire, striking the car as it sped away.Deputies arrived to find four people suffering from gunshot wounds. They were taken to a hospital for treatment. Avalos was found later with a gunshot wound at an area hospital, Hoxmeier said.Though the victims were shot in the limbs and torso -- and some required surgery -- sheriff's officials said their injuries were not life-threatening.Hoxmeier said it appeared there had been some fighting among club patrons earlier in the night and the shooting might have stemmed from that. However, the people who were shot do not appear to have been involved in the fights, he said.Investigators served a search warrant Sunday in the 26500 block of Ethanac Road in Menifee where they found the car used in the shooting.Authorities ask that anyone with information call investigators at the sheriff's Perris Station at 951-210-1049Follow Sarah Burge on Twitter: @sarahkburge
