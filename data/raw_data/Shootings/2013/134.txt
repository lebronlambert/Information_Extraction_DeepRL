The Republic | azcentral.com Sun Apr 14, 2013 10:26 PM  Two people were killed and four others were in the hospital with gunshot wounds after a drive-by shooting at a house party in Phoenix early Sunday morning, officials said.    Jason Jonathan Acosta-Ramos, 18, died from injuries he suffered during the shooting that occurred about 3:30 a.m. outside a home near 25th Avenue and Cactus Road, Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson said. The house party was to celebrate his birthday.    Phoenix police officials reported later in the day that Elliseo O. Cantu, 16, also died from his injuries.    A second 16-year-old boy was in extremely critical condition, a 17-year-old boy and 18-year-old boy suffered life-threatening injuries, and a 21-year-old man suffered non-life-threatening injuries, he said.    The house party was breaking up about 3:30 a.m. when some sort of altercation occurred, Thompson said. An unknown vehicle drove by and someone inside began to shoot into the crowd of people who were leaving, striking six people.    Acosta-Ramos’ friends drove him to the hospital, but he died of his injuries, he said.    The Phoenix Fire Department transported four others to the hospital, while the fifth tried to drive himself to the hospital when he was stopped by Glendale police officers, Thompson said. Fire paramedics then took him the rest of the way to the hospital.    “At that party, there was a lot of underage individuals that were drinking,” he said. “That along with the time of day it was and all of those things are a recipe for disaster.”    Police have little information on the shooter(s) or vehicle, Thompson said.    Anyone with information about the incident or the whereabouts of the shooter(s) is asked to call the Phoenix Police Department Violent Crimes Bureau at 602-262-6141, or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS or 480-TESTIGO for Spanish.
