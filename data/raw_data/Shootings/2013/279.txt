PATERSON — A man who allegedly shot five people, one fatally, in one night last week has been identified – and is being sought by police on murder charges, authorities said.  Kamal “Rico” Edge, 21, allegedly shot five people from 10 p.m. on June 21 to 2 a.m. on June 22, said Capt. Heriberto Rodriguez of the Paterson police.  One of the victims was Quenay Cox, a Paterson woman who was shot in the abdomen and managed to flee from the shooter, before dying on the street, police said.  The shooting started at the intersection of Putnam and Mercer streets, Rodriguez said. An unnamed victim was walking down the street when Edge allegedly approached, fired multiple rounds, and struck the man once in the hand.  About four hours later, Edge allegedly opened fire at a group of people near the intersection of East 22nd Street and Park Avenue. Cox was hit, ran away onto Park Street, but died shortly afterward, Rodriguez said.  But three other people were also hit in the barrage, police said. A 21-year-old woman from Paterson was also shot in the abdomen – but was treated and released from the hospital. A 39-year-old Paterson woman was shot in the chest and a 48-year-old Plainfield man was shot in the groin, right hand and right side of his hip, and both were hospitalized with serious injuries, Rodriguez said.  Criminal complaints have been signed for murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault and weapons offenses against Edge in connection with the two separate shootings.  Edge is known to frequent the area of Governor Street, and is described as standing 5-foot-7 and weighing 150 pounds, with numerous tattoos on his neck and arms, authorities said.  Detectives are asking anyone with information about the two shootings to call (973) 321-1120.
