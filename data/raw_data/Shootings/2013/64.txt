A birthday party in northwest Harris County ended in a gunfight that sent at least six people to different hospitals.  Deputies say several teens were gathered at a club house on T.C. Jester and Spears when another group of uninvited teens showed up. A fight began and spilled out to the parking lot where someone pulled out a gun.  Authorities say dozens of rounds were fired and several people were hit.  "I just saw blood on the ground and the officer told me that a young man might lose his life," said parent Cheree Rollins.  At last check, one person shot in the stomach was listed in critical condition. All of the other gunshot victims are expected to be OK.  ___________________________________________________________  Take ABC13 with you!
