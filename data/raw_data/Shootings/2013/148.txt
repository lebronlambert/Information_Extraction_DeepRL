Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies arrested at least four people in an early Monday morning shooting in Harvey that left five people injured, including three young children and two women, authorities said. According to John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, about 4:30 a.m. Second District patrol officers were at a school across the street from an apartment complex in the 2300 block of Lapalco Boulevard when they heard the tires of a car screeching and saw a car speeding out of the driveway of the apartment complex. Shortly thereafter, Fortunato said, the officers began receiving multiple reports of shots that had been fired.    Several units responded to the scene at the apartment complex where they found five people had been shot. Authorities said that the suspected gunmen knocked on the door of an apartment where there were seven people inside including children that were sleeping in the living room area. The men identified themselves as police and an adult opened the door.    Shots were fired and five people were shot, according to the JPSO. Three of the victims were children under the age of three; the other two adults were women, Fortunato said. All five were transported to Interim LSU Public Hospital where they were listed with non-life threatening injuries, Fortunato said.    Authorities chased the car with the suspected gunmen across the Crescent City Connection Bridge. Near an off-ramp by the Mercedes Benz-Superdome, the men jumped out of the car and a foot pursuit entailed. One of the men was apprehended near the Superdome and three other men were arrested shortly afterwards, Fortunato said.    One weapon was found inside of the car and two others were found near the down ramp next to clothes that the suspects had taken off.    No further information is available at this time.
