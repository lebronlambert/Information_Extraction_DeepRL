A 23 year-old man was killed and three others were wounded in a shooting that occurred around midnight Sunday. According to police, the four victims were standing outside of a residence in the 300 block of Home St. at 12:05AM when they were shot at multiple times by an unknown number of suspects, who subsequently fled the scene.  On Facebook, a 23 year-old Randy Chapman who went to Jordan High School and currently lives in Long Beach posted a photo of himself and his young daughter last week with the words "Daddy Daughter Day" written atop. His music, made under the name c4 or c4 da bomb, includes a song called "Green" that in a homemade music video discusses the rapper's "hustling" and shows images of drugs and money.  Police say they do not know if the shooting was gang-related, however, it occurred just a few blocks from the gas station at the corner of Del Amo and Long Beach boulevards where two weeks ago, a 10 year-old boy was struck by a stray bullet after an argument broke out among a group of males. The incident was caught on camera. The boy is recovering.
