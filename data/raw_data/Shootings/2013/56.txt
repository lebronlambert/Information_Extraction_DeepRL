At least four people are dead following a spree of shootings Tuesday morning in the vicinity of Tustin, California.  Police say the suspected shooter, identified as a 20-year-old student Ali Sayed, is among the dead. He reportedly took his own life after being stopped by officers in the city of Orange following the first three shootings, Lt. Paul Garaven of the Tustin Police Department tells the Orange County Register.  "When a stop was initiated, the suspect shot and killed himself," confirms the department.  The first shooting, early Tuesday, occurred near the Red Hill Avenue exit off of the Five freeway in conjunction with a carjacking at around 5:30 a.m. About 20 minutes later, police were informed of a second shooting on the 55 near the Edinger Avenue exit. The third shooting reportedly occurred near McFadden Avenue and the 55 freeway.  All three of the shootings occurred within a span of only 25 minutes, reports the Associated Press. A local NBC affiliate adds that police are investigating three separate potential crime scenes.  The shooter, Ali Syed, was an unemployed, part-time student who lived at the Ladera Ranch residence where the first victim was slain, Tustin police Chief Scott Jordan said.  Tustin, where the shootings occurred, has a population of roughly 76,000 and is around 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
