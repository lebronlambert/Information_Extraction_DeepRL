  Via WCBS 2 told the Star-Ledger, "[Mourners] were out there drinking all day long — that's probably what heated the whole thing up."  The incident occurred at around 10 p.m., at South 16th Street and Avon Avenue. According to WCBS 2, "A man drove up in a dark-colored vehicle, got out, opened fire and drove off." The girl was shot in the ankle, while a 22-year-old woman was shot in the buttocks, a 46-year-old woman was shot in the arm, a 48-year-old man was shot in the legs, and a 25-year-old was shot in the arm.  The vigil had been for the victim of a car crash blocks away. This morning, a man who lives in a South 16th Street home yelled at reporters, "It was my family! Get... up out my house. You only come out here when something happens... We're killing each other out here!"  The victims are in stable condition and the police are investigating. A neighbor said, "It’s time to move. It was quiet up until then. This is really close."
