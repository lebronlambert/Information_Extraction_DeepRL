Two police officers and a sheriff’s deputy were shot and wounded in a shootout and chase in Albuquerque, New Mexico Saturday morning.  The suspect, who fired at cops throughout the incident, was pronounced dead after the pursuit ended, police said.  Witnesses told the Albuquerque Journal that the man, who was carrying a large rifle, ordered a passer-by to call the police shortly before noon and then opened fire on officers who arrived.  NBC affiliate KOB.com said the suspect was carrying an AK-47 near the junction of Broadway and Pacific.  “Two Albuquerque Police Officers and one Bernalillo County Sheriff Deputy currently remain hospitalized at local area hospitals,” Albuquerque Police Chief Allen Banks said in a statement.  “We pray that all three will fully recover.”  There are multiple crime scenes and “a lot of witnesses that still need to be interviewed,” Banks added.  Carlos Correa, a tire technician, told The Albuquerque Journal that he and coworkers fled inside their shop and locked the doors after the suspect opened fire on officers responding to call.  The newspaper said the man stole the police vehicle belonging to the responding officers, prompting a large police pursuit.
