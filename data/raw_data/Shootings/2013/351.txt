        A man who was critically injured in a shooting in San Francisco’s Mission District early Friday morning has died, police and medical examiner’s officials said. Keith Smith, a 24-year-old San Francisco resident, was shot in the 3100 block of 16th Street just before 1:30 a.m. Friday, according to the medical examiner’s office. Smith was with a group of people who were standing outside when a suspect approached them and opened fire, police said.  He was struck in the upper body and abdomen by the gunfire and was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. A 22-year-old man was also shot in the lower leg while a third victim suffered a graze wound to his calf. Both of those victims are expected to survive, police said. The shooter fled north toward 15th Street and police were unable to find him. Police did not immediately have more information about the shooting today.
