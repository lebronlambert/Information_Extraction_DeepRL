By: Kara Duffy  March 4, 2013  Moultrie, GA- Neighbors who live along 2nd Street Southwest in Moultrie are trying to make sense of the tragic events that unfolded just before 10 o'clock Sunday night.  Investigators with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation say four friends were sitting out front of a house when somebody fired more than 30 shots in their direction.  One neighbor says he was inside his house when all of a sudden he heard multiple gun shots go off. He said he quickly grabbed his kids and laid down on the living room floor.  After about 30 seconds of gunfire, he said he went outside and that's when he saw two men laying in the front yard and a woman laying across the front porch screaming that she'd been shot.  "At this point we have one individual deceased, James Key. He's 50 years old from Moultrie," said Agent Steve Turner with the GBI. "We've got three other injured parties that we're not releasing the names of right now."  Investigators say they're following all leads in hopes of making an arrest, but right now, they have no specific suspects and no motive.  "We know there was no argument or anything like that at the scene," Agent Turner said. "We don't know if something had happened beforehand and this was pay back for that; we're just not sure right now," he said.  Investigators say one of the victims is in serious condition. One victim is in fair condition and the third has since been released from the hospital.  Anyone with information on this crime should contact the Georgia Bureau of Investigation or the Moultrie Police Department immediately.
