When the Bulls host the San Antonio Spurs on Monday they’ll be seeing a team that’s been able to morph successfully into different styles of play.  At various points of their era of excellence under coach Gregg Popovich, the Spurs have won with a defense-first mentality meant to grind out victories. And as their personnel has evolved they’ve turned into a group that wins with a flowing and well-oiled offense.  “(Popovich has) been awesome at that,” Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said.
