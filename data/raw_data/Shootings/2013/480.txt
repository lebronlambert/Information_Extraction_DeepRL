Four people were shot at a SoHo music club early Thursday morning after some out-of-town gang members insulted New York City during a rap concert, sources said.  The bloody mayhem erupted just after midnight during a mixtape party for the Washington D.C.-based rapper Fat Trel at SOB’s, also known as Sounds of Brazil, police said.  “It was mayhem,” said Avery Watson, 24, who was at the show. “We heard four or five shots. People were ducking and rolling on the floor.”  The victims were described as three men and a woman. Two were struck in the foot and two were grazed in the leg, a source said.  They were taken to Beth Israel Hospital and all were expected to survive.  Witnesses said that the shooting took place after an argument broke out between gang members.  The argument allegedly started when a Bloods gang member from New Jersey approached the stage and started to trash talk New York City, witnesses said.  “It was stupidity between some Bloods and Crips,” a witness said.  “It was so ignorant. People started yelling at each other and then a gun got pulled.”  Fat Trel himself took the Twitter after the incident to express his shock at the whole ordeal.  “The inside of my show jus got shut [shot] up in NYC!!!!” Fat Trel tweeted.  He said in a later tweet that someone “shot da whole clip at da [ground]. One ni—a got hit in da leg.”  An employee at the venue said that she was concerned that things were getting out of hand.  The crowd was chanting the name of Fat Trel’s mixtape “Sex, Drugs, Money, & Guns,” when the worker decided to leave the stage area and hide.  “When I heard ‘guns’ I knew it wasn’t safe and I went downstairs,” she said.  Witnesses said there was a stampede of people trying to get out as shattered glass and falling table injured a few others in the melee.  One male fled the scene in a black late-model Camaro.  Police were looking for him early Thursday morning, a law enforcement source said.
