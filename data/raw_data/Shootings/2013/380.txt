Marcus Holden was described by his long-time girlfriend as “a joyful person” who loved to have fun, listen to music and play with his children. But the 28-year-old Altgeld Gardens man’s life ended in a flurry of violence this past weekend.  Jeanette Johnson, 34, said she was near the 600 block of E. 131st Street early Sunday morning when a fight broke out between Holden and another man.  “He got into a fight with one person, and beat him up,” Johnson said, adding that a friend of that man jumped in, and Holden “was getting the best of him too.”    At some point, she said, one of those two men, or someone else, produced a gun and began shooting.  This took place at about 1:50 a.m., and police said Holden was shot multiple times, and found unresponsive at the scene. He was taken to Roseland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3 a.m..  Three other people were shot in the same incident. A 40-year-old man was shot multiple times. A 28-year-old woman was shot in the back. Both were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. A 22-year-old man was also shot, but went on his own to Metro South Medical Center in Blue Island, where he was treated for a gunshot wound to the buttocks.  Johnson said she’s known the Holden all her life, and has three children with him; a 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old twins. She said Holden attended Carver High School, and worked several jobs over the years. But he was unemployed when he died.  Cash Johnson, 18, a neighbor in the Altgeld Gardens public housing facility, described Holden as a “good person.”  “He used top always speak to the kids and tell them not to do bad things,” Johnson said.
