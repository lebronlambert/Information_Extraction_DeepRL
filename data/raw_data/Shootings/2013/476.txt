Police say 32-year-old Delonta Hendrix of Northwest was pronounced dead shortly after he was found shot in the 100 block of Pierce Street around 11:56 Thursday morning.  Officers responded to the 1100 block of 1st St NW after hearing gunshots, say police. They found an unconscious man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds in the 100 block of Pierce Street, NW. DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services took the victim to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to police.  Three other people were also found: One man was located in the 1100 block of 1st Street, NW suffering from multiple gunshot wounds to the lower body and taken to an area hospital for treatment; another man was located in the 100 block of Pierce Street, NW suffering from a gunshot wound to the leg; a third man who suffered from a gunshot wound to the forearm, was transported to an area hospital by a friend, say police.  MPD investigators are collecting evidence, which is about a block away from Walker-Jones Elementary School. Police activity blocked off some streets in the new NoMa neighborhood near Sursum Corda.  It is a struggling neighborhood, struggling to regain its new identity. The District now is calling this NoMa, North of Massachusetts Avenue. It has invested lots of money in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is still struggling with violence. We have been in the neighborhood before reporting on an overnight shooting.  A construction worker later on Thursday told us that he knew one fo the men who was shot. "One of the guys is my friend, so I'm at a loss for words right now," he said.  He told us he found out after someone sent him a message. When asked if he knew how his friend was doing, he told us, "I don't think he made it."  In tears, the construction worker walked away, heading to the job site, a new high-rise about a block away.  As the city invests new money in new construction, new services, enticing new residents to move to this new neighborhood, many feel progress is pushing others out.  David Hilmy a teacher at the Walker Jones Education campus, who has students that will have to walk by the crime scene, said, "I'll approach it like any other day and read the situation as it happens. We've been able to develop really good relationships with our kids, so we can see when one is a little bit off, a little bit, needs a little bit of help, and although this may be totally different related offense, some personal issues, the fact that it's occurred, it reflects the culture and the value and the pressure that this community is under."  Still, residents hope Sursum Corda can live up to its Latin meaning, and hearts will be lifted.  Police are offering a reward of up to $25,000 to anyone that provides information which leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons wanted for this crime. Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the police at 202-727-9099 or submit a tip by text messaging 50411.  Friday, DC Councilmember Tommy Wells announced he would hold a public safety meeting with the Northwest One community about the shooting. Wells, Northwest One community leaders and MPD representatives will listen to concerns and respond to questions at Mt. Airy Baptist church at 11 a.m. Friday.  In a statement released to the press, Wells said, "The senseless, tragic and violent shooting of four of our community members Wednesday night cannot go ignored or unanswered. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. These victims, their families, and this community deserve the support and attention of our entire city."
