ELYRIA — Two Lorain men have been indicted on murder and other charges for their roles in the New Year’s Day shooting at Liberty Gas that left one man dead.  Desmen Noble and Damian Bell, the two men facing charges, allegedly engaged in a gunfight outside the Cotton Club in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, but no one was hit during that exchange of gunfire.  About 20 minutes later, Lorain police were called to Liberty Gas on Broadway after shots were reported there.  According to police four people, Bell, Alan Tate, Tallis Moore and Herman Seagers were shot at the gas station. All but Seagers were shot in their legs and survived. Seagers was shot in the arm, chest and hand and died from his injuries.  Bell had originally faces weapons charges in the case, not murder charges. Noble was arrested on murder and other charges a day after the shooting.  Read Friday’s Chronicle for more on this story.
