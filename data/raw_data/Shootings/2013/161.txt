LAUDERDALE LAKES â€” A verbal argument erupted into gunfire, injuring four men, one critically, Saturday afternoon.  Broward Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Jachles said just before 4 p.m., deputies responded to a report of several people shot at Whispering Palms Apartments at 4500 NW 36 Street.  Authorities found two men, Gilespie Isaacs, 50, and his stepson Neville Lynch, 25, shot in apartment 205, said BSO.  Witnesses told BSO that an argument between Lynch and another man, David Rose, 22, intensified with threats of physical violence. This prompted Lynch, who was standing on the apartment balcony, to take out a handgun and shoot at Rose, who was on the ground below.  Rose was struck in the shoulder. Another man, Mark Rose, 25, shot back from the ground striking Lynch and Isaacs. Kevin Dobson, 25, was also shot but left the scene before deputies arrived, according to Jachles.  Lynch was airlifted to Broward Health Medical Center and listed in critical condition. Isaacs was also transported to Broward Health where he was treated and released.  BSO detectives said that Rose's actions were justifiable. He has a conceal weapons license but was arrested on an outstanding, unrelated order. The investigation is ongoing.  hcarney@tribune.com or 954-356-4188
