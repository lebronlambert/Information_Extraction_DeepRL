'I heard what I thought was firecrackers,' neighbor Bill Stephans said.  Police say to as many as seven men tried to get into a party at a house in the 300 block of Boerum Court, but they were turned away.  About 20 minutes later, guests at the party went up to them outside and asked them to leave and that's when one of the men started shooting. A person who was attending the party pulled his gun and returned fire, said police spokeswoman MPO Grazia Moyers.  David Zoro says dozens of teenagers were partying and when shots were fired, everyone ran away.  A short time later, two of the victims showed up at Sentara Independence with gunshot wounds. Soon after, dispatchers were informed that a third victim had shown up at Sentara Princess Anne and a fourth at Sentara Leigh hospitals.  Police have not released the age or gender of anyone involved in the shooting.    Neighbor Robin Gaffney explained the area is usually quiet and safe.  'Especially on this court right here all these neighbors know each other and there's just never been a problem.'    Read or Share this story: http://www.wvec.com/story/news/2014/09/09/14814154/
