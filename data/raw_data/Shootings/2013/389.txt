INKSTER (WWJ) – Inkster police are investigating an overnight shooting that left four people injured, including a child.  Police say the shooting happened around 8:15 p.m. Thursday outside of a residence on Oakwood Street near Middlebelt Road.  While en route to the scene, officers were advised that one of the victims arrived at an area hospital with a gunshot wound.  Officers arrived on the scene and found two additional gunshot victims with what appeared to be non-life threatening injuries.  While still at the scene, officers were advised that another subject arrived at a different area hospital with a gunshot wound.  Police say the victims were apparently targeted in a drive-by shooting. The suspect, a black male, got away in a black Dodge Charger, according to police.  The victims are apparently not cooperating with police, The Detroit News reported.  Anyone with information on the incident is urged to contact Inkster police at 313-563-9850 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP.  Inkster has been plagued with shootings over the past month, with numerous murders over the 4th of July holiday weekend. The city has recorded 13 homicides this year, surpassing last year’s total of 12, The Associated Press reported.  In early July, Inkster Police Chief Hilton Napoleon told WWJ his department simply doesn’t have enough manpower to patrol the city like they have in the past.
