OAKLAND GUN VIOLENCE: Four people were fatally shot in Oakland, Calif., in separate incidents within a six-hour span starting Friday afternoon. The police chief vowed to intensify anti-violence measures. The city had 131 homicides in 2012, the most since 2006 when there were 148. The fatalities include Ken Harbin, 17; Larry Lovette, 30 and Eddiebo Rodriguez, 20.  Ken Harbin was shot about 8:15 p.m. Friday in the 9400 block of Hillside Street in East Oakland, a few blocks from where he lived. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Police were not sure what he was doing on Hillside Street before he was killed but said he might have known people in the area.  Harbin’s death was the last in the series of bloody events that began at 2:30 p.m., when a 22-year-old Oakland man was shot multiple times in the 2300 block of East 17th Street in East Oakland.  The victim at first was awake and talking to authorities on the scene, but died later at Highlands Hospital where he was taken for treatement. The victim remained unidentified Saturday as authorities tried to contact his next of kin.  About a half-hour later, 30-year-old Larry Lovette of Stockton, who used to live in Oakland, was found shot to death on Canon Avenue at Wellington Street next to Dimond Park near the Glenview district and in the council area Schaaf represents.  Police believe he was killed elsewhere in Oakland and left at the site. At 4:15 p.m. Eddiebo Rodriguez, 20, of Oakland, was shot while driving in the 3400 block of West Street in West Oakland. Rodriguez’ car rolled to a stop in the driveway of a home on the street. People who knew him drove him in another vehicle to a hospital. He died at 5:26 p.m. Source
