MARGATE (CBSMiami) – Friday, just before midnight in a quiet gated community in Margate, chaos erupted with gunfire.  “It is, it’s pretty intense–scary too–concerned for my family as well because I don’t know who was shot or what happened,” said neighbor Patricia Santiago.  Four people, three men and one woman, were shot, according to authorities. Neighbors say the gun shots could be heard from the opposite end of the neighborhood.  Shortly after, armed officers swarmed the area with a flurry of lights and sirens, putting the neighborhood on lockdown.  A neighbor, Renald Prince said, “I saw police. I saw dogs K-9s, sheriff.”  It happened in front of a home on Santa Monica Drive. Crime Scene Investigators worked into the night, morning, and all day Saturday.  A neighbor, Kenny Myles, said “I think it’s crazy to pay all this money and stuff like this happens, especially with the police living around here.”  There were also two SUVs in the driveway that were towed away.  Each of them had a tire that appeared to be shot out.  Two of the victims, as of Saturday night, remained in critical condition, the other two were in stable.
