It is awful that young people join gangs and think that they are doing something. Get a real job. Work for a living! Do the things the right way the way our forefathers set this country up. It pisses me off that we have N.Korea threatening our country and we are worried about protecting our territory from lowly, uneducated thugs who actually think people are scared of them because they wear a certain color. Territory and apartments that I wouldn't let my dog live in by the way. Arrest all of these thugs and then get the parents for being negligent and not properly raising their kids.

These shootings that have been happening are all gang related. If you're a parent of one of these delinquents then you should know whether or not your child is in a gang. And if you dont then you're not doing your job. If they're living in your house which most of them probably are, then there should be no privacy. if you find guns, drugs or colors in their room then you need to act. if not, you're just as guilty when they pull the trigger or get shot because they were wearing the wrong color or the drug deal goes south. And to all the people that know who is in a gang and dont report them, youre just as guilty. Gangs breed violence and crime. Nothing good comes of them and if you're in one then you're an idiot. If you want power and respect and a sense of pride, join the military, learn a trade. And if you really want to shoot someone then go infantry or marines. Law enforcement cant do it on their own. Ignorance, Fear and silence have a strangle hold on this community and it will ultimately rip us apart.    Posted: Tuesday, April 9, 2013  Article comment by: Crystal Hawkins    First, I would like to say SORRY to families that have lost a loved on to this foolishness. I am a single parent of two teenagers (boy and girl). I try my very best to instill positive values that were taught to me by my grandparents, parents and numerous others. But, society today as a whole, has changed altogether. Yes, we say that we need role models and more people getting involved with the lives of theses children and I totally agree. Now, you have some parents that try to be their child's friend rather than raise them. I do believe that there should be a bond between you and your children, but define your boundaries. Don't uphold your children in their wrong doings, chastise them. Make it a priority to read and understand the Bible (ex. GOING TO CHURCH), have a family sit down meal, doing family outings, and pray together. Provide positive results is all that I am saying. Do not let them raise you!!!!! I remember when I was younger, if I even looked like I wanted to step out of line with my parents or grandparents, I would get dealt with then (and it was not a time out or punishment). Now, some of these parents do not want you to say anything to their children. If you do, then you are wrong. So, in my opinion only, this is what the result will be. Without GOD in our lives daily, we will never make it in this world. And again I say that this is just my OPINION....

This is a very complex situation and the first steps to fixing it is do away with these free trade agreements and get a nationwide drug addiction program in place........legalizing pot will help tremendously too.....believe it or not........

If some of these so called thugs were in real gang infested areas none of you would make it...A 90s baby? Please go and get yourself an education because you are obviously lacking any type of intelligence...    - Page 1 - Page 2      Article Comment Submission Form Please feel free to submit your comments.
