STILLWATER, Minn. (WCCO) — A judge found the man accused of killing a 9-year-old boy while randomly shooting at passing vehicles in Oakdale unfit to stand trial.  Tran is accused of killing 9-year-old Devin Aryal as he rode in his mom’s minivan on February 11.  During the shootings, Aryal was struck by gunfire while he rode in a minivan with his mother. His mother drove to a nearby Rainbow Foods parking lot and called for help, but he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at Regions Hospital shortly after his arrival.  Devin’s mother was shot in the arm. Additionally, a 68-year-old Oakdale woman, who was in a different vehicle, was also hit by gunfire.  Nhan Lap Tran will now be committed to the state security hospital in St. Peter.  He could still be found competent to stand trial at a later date.
