Officer Hilal Williams says 19-year-old Malcolm Hall was booked Saturday with four counts of attempted first-degree murder.  An online jail roster indicates that his bond had not been set Sunday.  Two Marrero, Louisiana men - 22-year-old Brandon Brown and 23-year-old Deron Bridgewater - turned themselves in earlier and were booked with the same charges. Their bonds are set at $1 million: $250,000 on each count.  It was not clear whether any of the suspects has an attorney.  The shooting injured four people, one seriously, during the run-up to Mardi Gras. Police have not released the victims' names.
