KSDK-TV Police respond to a fatal shooting Thursday, June 13, on Cherokee Street in St. Louis.  Four employees of a home health care business were killed in a murder-suicide Thursday in St. Louis, police said.  The gunman, a second man and two women were found shortly after 1:30 p.m. in the office of A K Home Health Care on the first floor of the Cherokee Place Business Incubator, which renovates buildings on the street and leases them as work spaces, police said.  Police identified the gunman late Thursday as Ahmed Dirir, 59. State and federal licensing records list a man with that name as the company's director.  His three victims were identified as Khadra Muse, 44; Seaeed Abdulla, 29; and Bernice Solomon-Redd, 54.  Police Capt. Michael Sack told reporters that video from a surveillance camera showed the gunman having an argument with the three others before opening fire.  "It appeared to be brief," he said. "We don't know if this was a thing that carried over into today or was initiated today."  The weapon, a semi-automatic handgun, was recovered at the scene, he said.  Abdisalam Elmi, a Somali immigrant who drives a cab, told NBC station KSDK of St. Louis that he knew all four victims.  "They are very hard workers," he said in an on-camera interview. "They're friendly. They always smile for me."  "This is the worst day in my life," he said, adding: "I pray for peace, for love, no hate."
