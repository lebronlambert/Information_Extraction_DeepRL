PHILADELPHIAâ€”Police say three teenagers and a man were injured by gunfire from a car as they were standing outside a corner store in north Philadelphia.  A police spokeswoman says the four were on a street in the East Germantown section of the city at about 8:30 p.m. Saturday when a sedan pulled up to a stop sign.  Police said someone in the car opened fire from the passenger side of the vehicle, which then fled south.  Investigators said a 20-year-old man and teenagers aged 15, 16 and 17 were hit in the shoulder, buttocks and legs.  The Philadelphia Daily News says they were taken to Albert Einstein Medical Center and listed in stable condition.  Police were seeking a grey or black sedan with perhaps three people inside.
