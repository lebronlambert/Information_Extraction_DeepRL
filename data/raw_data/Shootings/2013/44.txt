New Orleans police are seeking a fourth suspect in a quadruple shooting on Bourbon Street during the weekend leading up to Mardi Gras.  Four people were wounded in the Feb. 9 incident when gunfire erupted in the 400 block of Bourbon Street after an argument involving three men. The intended victim was shot in the stomach, and three bystanders were injured.      On Monday night, police released a video of the latest suspect, who has yet to be identified. Detectives believe the man may go by the name "Brandon," "B-Money," or "B." He is believed to live on the West Bank in Westwego or Harvey, and drive a 2006 four-door silver or gray Chevrolet Impala.  Since then, police have made three arrests in the case: 22-year-old Brandon Brown , 23-year-old Deron Bridgewater and 19-year-old Malcolm Hall
