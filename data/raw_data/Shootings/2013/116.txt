One man was killed and three others injured in a shooting on a residential street in Long Beach early Sunday morning, authorities said.  Randy Chapman, a 23-year-old Long Beach resident, suffered wounds to his upper body and was pronounced dead at a local hospital, according to police spokesperson Marlene Arrona.  Three other men at the scene were also hit by gunfire and transported to a hospital, police said. Late Sunday morning, two were listed in critical condition and one had been treated and released, Arrona said.  The men appear to have been outside a residence in the 300 block of East Home Street when they were shot. Police said it was unclear whether there was one or multiple assailants, and that whoever did the shooting, which took place shortly after midnight, immediately fled the scene.
