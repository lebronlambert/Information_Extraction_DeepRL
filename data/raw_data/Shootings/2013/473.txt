One Dead, Six Wounded In Three Separate Bridgeport Shootings  Five of the victims were shot on Tuesday afternoon in the area of Reservoir and Trumbull avenues, leaving 26-year-old Christopher Pettway dead, police said.  BRIDGEPORT â€” Three separate shootings on Tuesday and Wednesday left one man dead and six others wounded, police said.  At about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, police responded to Reservoir Avenue near Cityview Avenue for a report of shots fired. The victim in that shooting, 23-year-old Sean Lawrence, was discovered later on Hawley Lane in Trumbull, police said. He told police he was shot in the leg while walking in the area of Reservoir and Cityview and was taken to Saint Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport for treatment.  Lawrence also said he was good friends with Pettway.  Later on Wednesday, on the city's West Side, police responded to the 100 block of Wood Avenue for a report of gunshots and a car fleeing the area, police said. A victim arrived at Saint Vincent's about 50 minutes later with a gunshot wound to his chest, police said. He was identified Kevin Boyd, 21, of Bridgeport.  As of Wednesday evening, no arrests had been made in these shootings. But a 28-year-old Bridgeport man is facing gun charges after police developed evidence that he may have been planning to retaliate for Tuesday's homicide. Jalil Hill was arrested Wednesday afternoon and charged with criminal possession of a firearm by a felon, having a weapon in a motor vehicle and carrying a pistol without a permit, police said.  The other victims of Tuesday's shooting were identified by police on Wednesday as Juwan Edwards, 15, Aijaholn Tisdale, 19, and Leroy Shaw, 15, all Bridgeport residents who sustained non-life-threatening-injuries, police said.  A fifth victim, 19-year-old Tamir Hamilton, came to police later and reported that he was with the others when the shooting began on Reservoir and that he was grazed in the ankle by a bullet, police said.
