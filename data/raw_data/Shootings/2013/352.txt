One teen is dead and four others were injured after gunfire erupted at a 15-year-old girl’s birthday party in a Hamilton Township, N.J., home Friday night.  About 100 people were in the living room of the home celebrating the girl’s birthday when gunshots were fired at about 11:30 p.m., CBS Philly reported.  Mercer County prosecutors said 17-year-old Shakir Williams of Trenton, N.J., was shot to death with multiple gun shot wounds and was pronounced dead on the scene.  Another 17-year-old boy is hospitalized in critical but stable condition after a five-hour surgery with wounds to the torso, arms, leg and groin.  Three of the other male victims — an 18-year-old and two 17-year-olds — were shot in the legs and released Sunday morning, ABC 6 Action News reported.  Prosecutors said there have been no arrests at this time and no one is in custody.
