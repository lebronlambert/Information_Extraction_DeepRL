An investigation is underway in southwest Atlanta, where four people, including a 60-year-old woman, were shot.  The shooting happened shortly after midnight at a home on Fair Street, west of the Atlanta University Center.  Brenda Norman, 60, was shot in the shoulder. A 40-year-old man was shot in the ankle, and a 15-year-old girl was shot in the arm. A bullet grazed a fourth person, police said.  The daughter of 60-year-old Brenda Norman told Channel 2’s Amanda Cook the shooting stemmed from a neighborhood fight that happened five days ago. Saturday morning, she said, someone came back and shot up her mom’s house out of retaliation.  Channel 2 Action News crews saw several officers among the large crowd of people near the home after the shooting.  "My mom, Brenda Ann Norman, she's 60 years old. My cousin also got shot, and her best friend got shot,” the woman said.  Norman spoke to Cook shortly after she got home from a hospital. Norman is outraged that someone would react so violently after Tuesday's incident.  "I went out there and tried to help them stop the thing. And the next thing I know, one of the guys swung on my 17-year-old granddaughter and busted her lip. Had her mouth all swollen up. Then the whole neighborhood went crazy."  Meanwhile, police say the victims are recovering and they’re expected to be OK. But Norman's daughter said she is still fuming over happened.  "That's my mom. I (don’t have) but one. That's how I got here. How everybody got here -- through a woman," she said. "This (has) been going on since Tuesday. Enough is enough."  Norman refuses to stay in her home of 19 years while the gunmen are on the loose.  "Baby, if I have to go sleep under that underpass, I'll go sleep on a deck," she said. "But I'm going to take my kids out of this house today. It's dangerous here."
