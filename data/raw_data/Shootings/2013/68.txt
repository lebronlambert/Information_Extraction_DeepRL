Four people were shot, one fatally, overnight Friday in three incidents within a 10-block area of the city’s Bailey-East Delavan neighborhood.  A 22-year-old man who was shot drove a couple of blocks before crashing his vehicle. He later died. The man, identified as Michael D. Smith, was shot once while driving a Dodge Durango in the area of Lang Avenue and Hagen Street shortly after 8:30 p.m. Friday.  He crashed into another vehicle at Newburgh and East Delavan avenues, about two blocks from the shooting scene. The victim, who was bleeding badly, was taken to Erie County Medical Center, where he died, police said.  “He had a single gunshot wound to his thigh area, and he succumbed to his injury,” Buffalo Chief of Detectives Dennis J. Richards said.  Two other shootings involving three victims occurred nearby, in the Bailey-Schreck and Roslyn Street areas. “Our Homicide Squad and district detectives are looking into any connection between these three shooting incidents,” Richards said.  The second shooting occurred about 10:10 p.m. on Roslyn. Robert Proctor was shot in the right rear thigh. He was taken to ECMC, where he was treated and released.  At about 12:30 a.m. Saturday, Tevin Sapp and Seth McMorris were struck in a drive-by shooting in the Bailey-Schreck area. Sapp was wounded in the lower left leg and McMorris was shot twice in the buttocks. Sapp was treated in ECMC, then released. The hospital had no information on McMorris.  Anyone with any information on any of the shootings is asked to call or text the Buffalo police confidential tip line at (716) 847-2255 or email the department at www.bpdny.org.  email: gwarner@buffnews.com
