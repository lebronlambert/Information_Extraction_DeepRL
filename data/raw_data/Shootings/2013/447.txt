FILED UNDER      ST. LOUIS, Mo. (KSDK) - Four people were injured by gunfire early Sunday morning.  According to police, officers working secondary detail at the Loft Night Club responded to the BP gas station in the 3100 block of Olive around 1:30 a.m. after hearing gunshots.  The officers found a male victim, 22, with a gunshot wound to his calf. He was transported to a local hospital in stable condition.  Three other males also suffered injuries, but were transported to hospitals by unknown persons. Those victims included a 24-year-old with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 34-year-old with a gunshot wound to the thigh, and a 20-year-old with a gunshot wound to the foot. All three are in stable condition.  Police said the shootings were a result of an argument and physical altercation involving a suspect, 27, and the four victims. An investigation revealed a group of males were sitting on the suspect's car and refused to move. The suspect then retrieved a gun from his vehicle and began firing shots at the group.  While police were interviewing witnesses, the suspect returned to the scene and was arrested. A gun was recovered from the suspect.  There is no word yet on whether the gunman will be charged.    KSDK
