Dallas police say four people were wounded by gunfire in the parking lot of this McDonald's on Royal Lane.  Dallas police say four men standing in a restaurant parking lot were shot by an unknown person Sunday.  The shooting took place at a McDonald's restaurant on the 2400 block of Royal Lane in Dallas.  Sgt. Warren Mitchell, with the Dallas Police Department, said three men suffered leg wounds in the shooting while a fourth victim was shot in the posterior.  Police said the victims -- who range in age from 18 to 21 -- were taken to area hospitals. Details on their conditions weren't immediately available.  Mitchell had no information on a possible suspect in the shootings, though police are investigating whether the gunfire stemmed from an earlier argument at a nearby club.
