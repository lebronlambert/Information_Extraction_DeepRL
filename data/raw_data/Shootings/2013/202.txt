DETROIT (WWJ) – Four people were wounded and a 60-year-old woman was killed Wednesday after a quiet Detroit neighborhood erupted in gunfire.  The shooting happened around 8 p.m. a home on the 9000 block of Carlin, near Schaefer and West Chicago, on the city’s west side.  Sgt. Eren Stephens said a group of children were playing outside when an adult sent one of the youngsters home. That young person apparently went home and told a family member, Stephens said, and a 24-year-old returned with a gun a short time later and began shooting.  A total of five people were shot, including a 15-year old girl, a 24-year-old woman, a 32-year-old woman and a 58-year-old man. They were listed in temporary serious condition at a local hospital. A 60-year-old woman died on the scene. Stephens said those involved in the shooting all knew each other.  Police are now searching for the gunman, who fled the scene after the shooting.  Anyone with information is asked to call Detroit police at 313-596-2260 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP.
