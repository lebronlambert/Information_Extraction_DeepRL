CHESTER - A drive-by shooting in the city late Saturday afternoon left one teen dead and several other people injured, police said.  Witnesses say someone inside a burgundy color four door vehicle pulled up next to a group standing at Rose and Upland streets about 5:45 p.m. on Saturday. Several men inside the vehicle pointed weapons out of the window and opened fire, unloading more than 20 rounds, before fleeing the scene, according to NBC10.  "I just heard, 'bom, bom, bom,'" said Luz Nieves. "I thought it was fireworks."  Police say Jesse Burton, 17, was shot in the head. He was taken to the Crozer-Chester Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Burton's cousin, a 16-year-old, was shot in both legs. An 18-year-old man was shot in the right leg and a 40-year-old man was shot in the chest. Witnesses say the 40-year-old was walking to a nearby store during the shooting and he was likely an innocent bystander. Police say the 16-year-old is in stable condition, the 18-year-old is in serious but stable condition and the 40-year-old is critical but stable.

"If you're sitting in your living room you have to worry that a bullet will come through the window and strike you in the back of your head," she said.  A large crowd gathered outside the hospital after the victims were taken there.  Police say they are searching for two to three suspects in the shooting. They also say they found the shell casings for at least two weapons at the scene.
