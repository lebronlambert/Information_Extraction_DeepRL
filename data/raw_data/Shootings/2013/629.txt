× Violent, confusing day in Gary leaves 3 dead, several injured  Gary police are questioning one person of interest and the search for multiple people continues after seven people were shot overnight and three of them died.  The violence began early Monday morning in the 6200 block of W 29th when several masked men showed up.  Inside, 22-year-old Rolando Correa was one of four people shot and the only one to die.  A few hours later, there was another report of a shooting at 21st and Virginia. 34-year-old Damian Reedus was shot and killed inside of a minivan driven by his girlfriend, who was also shot. Another man inside the van at the time is believed to be the gunman.  The body of 28-year-old Andre Woods was found shot and dumped alongside the road at 32nd and Georgia.  Gary police call the shooting disturbing, noting a sharp rise in murders this year.  “We want people to feel safe and we will do everything in our power that they’re still safe,” said Corporal Gabrielle King of the Gary Police. “But we can’t really control a person who takes it upon themselves to arm themselves and then shoot somebody.”  Police are investigating the possibility that two of these three killings may be related.  They’re asking for anyone with information to come forward.
