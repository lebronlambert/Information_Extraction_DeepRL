KENTWOOD, MI -- Police today said two people remain in the hospital after five young people were injured Sunday when a gunman showed up at a graduation party.  A 21-year-old woman, shot in the face, and a 20-year-old man, shot twice in the torso, are both in stable condition at the hospital and are recovering, police said.  Kentwood police today released the victims' ages and type of wounds.  Police also said they do not expect an arraignment today for a man arrested Monday in connection with the 11:45 p.m. shooting at a Farmview Court SE home.  Prosecutors have asked police to continue investigating "due to the complexity of the case and the number of witnesses involved," Kentwood police Chief Tom Hillen said in a statement.
