A 2-year-old girl who was shot by her mother this month in northeast Denver continues to improve, her relatives said Monday.  "She opened her eyes today," Liliana Castro said of her niece, Isabel Perez, who remains hospitalized at Denver Health Medical Center. "We're just waiting to see when she will get out of the hospital."  On Feb. 6, Isabel's mother, Mayra Perez, 23, shot and killed her other two children, Nevaeh Morales, 4, and Erick Perez, 1, Denver police have said. She then fatally shot herself inside the home the family shared in the 4900 block of North Pearl Street.  Relatives, including Isabel's father, Ricky Perez, remain by Isabel's bedside.  Police have not disclosed a motive but have said the couple had been arguing, and Ricky Perez left the house the night before to cool off. He returned the next day, discovered the bodies of his wife and children and called 911.  Castro said it is unclear when Isabel might be able to leave Denver Health.
