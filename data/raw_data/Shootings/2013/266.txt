We're learning more about a shooting at a Kentucky condo that killed three people and critically injured a fourth.  The shooting happened late Wednesday afternoon in the south end of Louisville at the 1900 block of Gardiner Lane.  Witnesses, like Alexa Hall, are speaking out about what they saw immediately after the shooting. Hall says she was at the pool for only 20 minutes when the Lakeview Condominiums turned into a crime scene.  "The little boy said, 'My mom has been shot! Shots were fired. Shots were fired!'" said Alexa Hall, who lives at the complex. "And he went up to Alex, the lifeguard, and nobody really knew what to do. Everybody was just in panic."  As of Wednesday night, Louisville television stations are reporting that police say a juvenile female, a 38-year-old woman, and a 40-year-old man are dead following this shooting. We are told the surviving victim is a woman in her 60s who has life-threatening injuries. Louisville police tell us they believe the shooter is one of the dead.  "It's still very early to say what type of motive this would be," said Dwight Mitchell, who is with the Louisville Police Department. "What we want to say is it's a very tragic situation and obviously tragic for the victims and their families. As far as a motive, at this point, it would be hard for me to determine that."  For those living at the complex, they are still in shock and disbelief that a shooting inside an apartment happened where they live.  "It's unbelievable," said Joey Hopper, who lives at the complex. "I mean I live in the building next to it. And it's just crazy to think it can happen in your own neighborhood when this is a great neighborhood."  "It's just crazy because nothing like that has ever happened around here in the just middle of the day," said Hall.  For now, yellow crime scene tape lines the complex as police continue to investigate. Louisville Police are not yet releasing the names of the suspect or victims in this case.
