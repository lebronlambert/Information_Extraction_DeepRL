Montgomery Police: "Drug deal gone bad" sparked shootout Posted: Monday, July 1, 2013 6:05 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, July 11, 2013 6:05 PM EDT  A shootout at a Montgomery apartment complex left one person dead, two others with gunshot wounds, and another person assaulted Tuesday afternoon.  "One of the victims informed the detectives that this was a drug deal gone bad," said Chief Kevin Murphy, of the Montgomery Police Department. "That's his words."  The situation started around 4 p.m. when officers responded to a shots fired call at the Red Lion Apartment complex on Woodbridge Drive off Narrow Lane Road.  "At first, it was real strong powerful shooting," said Rosa Ford, who lives near the complex. "I said somebody getting shot down the street."  Authorities say four people were involved in the shooting. They fled the scene in two vehicles.  A short time later, one vehicle came to Baptist South Hospital with two people inside. Authorities say one person has some sort of assault injuries and will recover. The second person was suffering from a gunshot wound and later died of their injuries.  The second vehicle was spotted by MPD officers and a short pursuit was started. It ended near Sussex Drive and the East South Boulevard. The vintage Chevy evaded a power pole, but crashed into a sign at a church.  "They just barely made it through there," said Michael Brayson, who lives across the street from the church. "They hit it and they jumped out and started running."  Officers both people were suffering from gunshot wounds. They were transported to the hospital. At last check, both men are reported to be in stable condition.  "Very hard for a community, for law-abiding good citizens to put their arms around this type of thing," Chief Murphy said. "Because you have illegal activity, the sale of narcotics, the sale of drugs, and when it goes bad, it gets worse."  Copyright 2013 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.
