Three people were killed and at least five others were wounded in South Side shootings Wednesday afternoon and evening.

The man killed is thought to be in his 20s.  Police had no details on the circumstances of the slaying Wednesday evening.  About 2:15 p.m., a man was fatally shot in the Far South Side Roseland neighborhood, police said. He was in the 0 to 100 block of West 107th Street when two shooters walked up and opened fire.  The man, 34, was shot multiple times and taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he later died, police said.  Two separate shootings just blocks apart in the West Pullman neighborhood left one man dead and another wounded about the same time Wednesday afternoon.  At 1:08 p.m., a 25-year-old man was shot in the neck and side at 122nd and Halsted streets, police said. He was taken to Roseland Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  One minute earlier, a man had suffered a graze wound at 122nd and Carpenter streets. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where his condition was “stable.”  Four people were wounded in a Bronzeville neighborhood shooting about 5:45 p.m., police said. Two males and a female were all at “stable” condition at area hospitals. Police later located a fourth male hurt in the attack.
