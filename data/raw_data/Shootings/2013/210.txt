NEW MARKET, Alabama -- A graduation party for Buckhorn High School ended violently late Tuesday when someone opened fire in the crowd, sending four partygoers to the hospital with various injuries.      The shooting took place close to 10:30 p.m. at the house party near the intersection of Michael Drive and Winchester Road. Students from several schools were in attendance.  Madison County deputies say the situation started as a fight out in the yard. One teen pulled out a small caliber handgun and began firing. He fled before authorities arrived.  Three teens were injured in the attack. One girl was shot in the abdomen. She was going into surgery at Huntsville Hospital as of the last report shortly before 2 a.m. The other two, both males, suffered leg wounds and went to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.    Authorities are confident they will arrest a suspect soon. They said they have good witnesses plus physical evidence. They are also looking for other persons of interest.      Worried parents crowded the intersection outside the sheriff's barricade near the crime scene. They were allowed to stay in phone contact with their parties inside. Several groups shared unconfirmed reports of what happened while waiting for their children to finish questioning.  Deputies said all information was conveyed to parents during the investigation.  Most partygoers were allowed to leave close to 2 a.m.  Watch a statement below from someone who was there when it happened. Brandon DeSouza, an 18-year-old student at James Clemens High School, told reporters what he witnessed.
