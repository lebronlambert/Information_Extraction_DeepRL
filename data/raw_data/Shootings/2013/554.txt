Bally's Hotel and Casino was the site of a shooting Monday that left one person dead and four injured. According to an October 21 news report from the Christian Post, the alleged gunman, who was also injured in the Las Vegas nightclub shooting, has been charged with several felonies.

Authorities say the suspect walked into the popular after-hours nightclub and asked if he could check out the place before paying. Door staff complied and the man walked around and returned a short time later to pay.  Moments later, he asked for a full refund, apparently not happy with the venue. When the manager arrived and denied his request, an argument ensued and the gunman allegedly shot the supervisor in the arm.  Several security staff members and a patron intervened in an attempt to subdue the shooter. However, at least two employees were shot and the patron was killed.  The unidentified gunman and three others were taken to a local hospital, where they were treated. There conditions are unknown at this time.  Nonetheless, Clark Country authorities charged the man with one count of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder.  The night club shooting at Bally's hotel is still under investigation.  The Strip was the site of a wild shooting in February where three people died and six others were injured during a car chase. The alleged shooter is awaiting trial in that incident.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you like this article, you can follow the writer by visiting and liking his Facebook page, or subscribe to receive email updates when a new article is published.
