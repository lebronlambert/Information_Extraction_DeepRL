Phoenix Police have released the names of the four people killed in a shooting rampage Saturday, October 26, at a Phoenix townhome near West Hazelwood and 17th Avenue. The name of the suspect, who died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, was also released.  According to police, the four victims were Bruce Moore, 66, Michael Moore, 42, Renee Moore, 36, and Shannon Moore, 17. Bruce was Renee's father and Michael was Renee's husband (Michael took his wife's last name). Shannon was the couple's teenage son. The family's two dogs were also shot and killed.  The suspected shooter was identified as 56-year-old Michael Dante Guzzo.  According to Sergeant Tommy Thompson, Guzzo may have been angered at the family's barking dogs, but the exact cause of the shooting rampage is still unclear.  Guzzo used a pump-action shotgun in the attack. According to a Phoenix PD press release, after killing the family, Guzzo also shot through the front door and window of another home in the same complex, but failed to make entry.  Guzzo's dead body was found by the Phoenix SWAT team in his townhouse, which is directly next door to where the victims were discovered.  Police were initially called to the scene at about 9 a.m. by someone saying their home had been shot at. When police and SWAT responded, they eventually made entry into the victims' home where two bodies were found on the patio area "obviously deceased," according to Thompson. A sweep of the home turned up two more dead bodies and the two dead dogs.  A witness told police they saw Guzzo entering the neighboring unit where the SWAT team found his body with the pump-action shotgun next to it.  This story was clarified to better explain the relationship between the four victims.
