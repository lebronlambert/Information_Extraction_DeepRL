The Arizona Republic -12 News Breaking News Team Sun Oct 6, 2013 8:44 AM  Avondale police are investigating a shooting at an apartment complex Sunday morning that sent four people to the hospital.  Two of them were in critical condition, Avondale Police Department spokesman Sgt. Brandon Busse said. The conditions of the other two were not immediately clear.  There were few details about what caused the shooting or the identity of the gunman.  Shots rang out about 6 a.m. at a house party gone wrong inside an apartment in the Versante luxury apartment complex near 111th Avenue and Van Buren Street, Busse said.  Detectives were interviewing witnesses to try to determine what caused the shooting and who the shooter was, he said. It was not clear how many shots were fired or if there were multiple shooters.  All those who were shot were adults, but their ages and genders were not immediately known, he said. It wasn't clear if anyone at the party was under 18.  Busse said this appeared to be the first incident to occur at the apartment complex.  "Nothing for residents to worry about right now," he said. "There's no need for any concern for anything that could happen."
