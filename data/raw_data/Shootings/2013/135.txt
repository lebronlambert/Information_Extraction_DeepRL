Police say there were several hundred people inside the center when shots were fired, both inside and outside the alley. Weâ€™re told some employees locked themselves in the freezer to keep safe, others tried to make their way outside.  Two victims were transported to the UK Hospital where police said one person died. The Fayette County Coroner identified the victim as 22-year-old Steven Reynolds of Lexington. He died from a gun shot wound. Three others were taken to Good Samaritan Hospital. One of those victims was later taken to UK with serious injuries.  Police are looking over surveillance video to try and establish who fired shots and what led up to the shooting.  We spoke to Danny Collins, President of Collins Bowling Centers, Inc.  While addressing the event held Sunday night when the shots were fired, he said, "It's an environment that, they had a couple of DJs in here. It's a different environment than we've had in the past, so, of course we won't be doing this kind of thing anymore."  Collins said there was some damage to the doors and inside the bowling alley, but that he expects the lanes will open back up Tuesday.  WKYT will continue to bring you updates as they become available.
