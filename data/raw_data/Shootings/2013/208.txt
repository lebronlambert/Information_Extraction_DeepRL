CHICAGO (STMW) — Four people were hurt in a gang-related shooting after large groups of teenagers started fighting in the street Monday night in the West Side Austin neighborhood.  About 9:30 p.m., someone in a light-colored sedan drove by the fight in the 5300 block of West Iowa Street and opened fire, police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said.  A woman, 19, was shot in the knee, while a 17-year-old girl was shot in the thigh, Alfaro said. Both were taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in “stable” condition.  A 14-year-old boy was grazed in the abdomen and an 18-year-old woman was grazed in the arm, Alfaro said. Both were taken to Loretto Hospital in “stable” condition.
