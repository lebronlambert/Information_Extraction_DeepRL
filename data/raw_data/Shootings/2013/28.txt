ST. LOUIS (KMOX) â€“ One person who was shot along with three other men in a drive-by shooting late Friday in North St. Louis has died.  It appears the victims were leaving the funeral of man who was a victim of an earlier homicide when someone in an S.U.V. fired shots from an assault weapon into their car at Riverview and West Florissant.  One gunshot victim was found by police at that location. A second victim was found at Bircher and Geraldine. That person was shot in the head and later died.  The third and fourth victims were found at Lillian and Goodfellow along with their bullet riddled car.  Police continue to look for suspects and think the shootings were in retaliation for the shooting death of a man last week. His funeral was earlier today.
