Kansas City Police Chief Darryl Forte says one of the nine people injured in a shooting early Sunday has died.  Officers said the shooting happened inside and outside of a motorcycle club near 19th Street and Prospect Avenue at about 3:30 a.m. Officers said they saw a large number of people running and driving away from the scene.  Forte had said earlier that a woman was on life support with a gunshot wound to the head. Police have not identified the person who died but said it was a man. At least one other person had serious injuries from the shooting.    Most of the other victims suffered minor injuries. Many were treated at hospitals and released.  Forte said there were between 250 and 300 people at the club when officers first arrived. He said police were in the area and were able to reach the scene quickly.  Officers have spent much of the morning interviewing a large number of witnesses who were at the scene. They have not announced any arrests in the case.  Anyone with information about the shootings is encouraged to call the Crime Stoppers TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477.
