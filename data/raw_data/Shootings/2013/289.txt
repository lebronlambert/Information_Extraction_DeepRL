VIRGINIA BEACH -- Police have identified the victim killed in a multiple victim shooting at Virginia Beach Town Center over the weekend.  Police sayRashawn R. Dukes, 25 of the 2800 block of Ennismore Court, North Chesterfield, Virginia was killed and four others were injured.  Public Information Officer Tonya Borman said that police responded to a shooting in the 4600 block of Columbus Street around 1:31 a.m. on Sunday.  Initial reports indicated multiple gunshots were fired in the area near Guadalajara Restaurant.  When officers arrived they located two victims, one of them died at the scene.  Shortly after, police were notified that three additional victims were located at a local hospital. The extent of their injuries is unknown, but all three suffered gunshot wounds.  A motive in the shooting is unclear and the incident remains under investigation.Police have not released details regarding potential suspects.  Alex Yousefi owns a coffee shop just down the street from the shooting. He's concerned the violence might drive away customers. 'Town Center is growing constantly. They're building things constantly, residential and commercial. I just don't think it has good positive affect on the Town Center as a whole.'    City Council member Bill Desteph wants to make sure families feel safe coming to Town Center. 'We normally have one or two police officers down at Town Center at any one time. Town Center is a very safe location in the city. It's extremely safe; there's no reason to get concerned or worried over an isolated incident.'  Another shooting took place outside of Guadalajara nearly three years ago during Michael Vick's 30th birthday party. Desteph doesn't think the restaurant attracts trouble. 'I go there for lunch quite a bit; I've been there for dinner. I've never had any issues. It's not one that raises a flag in the city.'
