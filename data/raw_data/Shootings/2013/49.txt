As the New Castle County Courthouse in Delaware remained partially closed Wednesday, two days after a gunman killed two people and then himself inside its lobby, the gunman's daughter told a local paper she thinks his deteriorating health played a role in the shooting.  Thomas Matusiewicz, 68, knew his ex-daughter-in-law Christine Belford would be in court Monday for a child support hearing and had staked out a spot in the lobby, police said. When she walked in, he shot her at close range using a .45-caliber handgun. Matusiewicz’s spray of bullets also killed Laura Mulford -- a neighbor who had accompanied Belford -- and injured two capitol police officers. He then turned the gun on himself.  But Matusiewicz's daughter, Amy Gonzalez, told the (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal that her father had a brain tumor "for at least 15 years” and that she thinks knowing he was sick played a role in the shooting.  “I know he was trying to do what was best for the family,” she said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t the right way.”
