The man, identified as Brandon Reese, was also charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal use of a firearm.  The authorities did not say whether Mr. Reese was the only suspect in the shooting, or whether any others involved might still be at large. The shooting killed Mario Lopez, 18, and left a 13-year-old boy, who was shot in the neck, critically wounded. Two other boys, ages 14 and 15, were each shot in the leg.  The shooting, which the police said appeared to be an outburst of gang violence, occurred while the teenagers stood together in front of 472 Marcy Avenue. Each of the victims appeared to have been in a gang, the police said.  Police officials said the violence appeared to be linked to a rivalry between gangs from rival housing complexes.  Such battles between teenagers, which the police say are often over territory and respect, account for many of the cityâ€™s shootings.
