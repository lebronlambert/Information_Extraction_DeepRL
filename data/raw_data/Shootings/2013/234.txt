The shooting took place at Zarkos nightclub on the corner of Teutonia and Atkinson. None of the injuries are expected to be life threatening.  Police have not said what led to the shooting, or if any suspects are in custody. Neighbors say the club is a trouble spot.  "Everyday I go there and pick up bottles, and windows of cars that are the customers of Zarkos, that they try to break into them, and have to sweep that all up and they've done damage to my building, backed into my doors and stuff like that," says Gilly Schultz.  Schultz owns an auto repair shop right next door and says the club is no stranger to violence, even a murder.  "Less than a month ago there was a shooting where they shot from our property at the corner of the building into the Zarkos lot," says Schultz.  Schultz says the club has changed hands several times over the last four decades. He believes the recent violence may be it's worst.  "I think there is a couple of businesses in the neighborhood that would like to see Zarkos closed because of that. I know Astraunatics across the street has had bullet holes through their windows," says Schultz.  Police say this is an open investigation. They are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call the police department.
