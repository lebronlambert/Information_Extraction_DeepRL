Second arrest made in deadly shooting in Bridgeport Posted: Thursday, September 26, 2013 2:24 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, October 24, 2013 2:27 PM EDT  The following photo of David Anderson was provided by the Bridgeport Police Department.  A 20-year-old Bridgeport man was the second person arrested in connection with a shooting that left one man dead and four others injured earlier this month.  Five men, who are between the ages of 15 and 19, were reportedly shot in the area of Reservoir and Trumbull avenues in Bridgeport on Sept. 10.  One victim, who was identified as 26-year-old Christopher Pettway, of Bridgeport, was shot in the back and died a short while later, police said.  The other three men were shot in the butt, femur and possibly the eye, but all are expected to recover from the injuries, police said.  David Anderson was arrested on Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to commit murder.  Police arrested Roderick "Riki" Rodgers on Sept. 16. Rodgers was charged with one count of murder and four counts of attempted murder.  Investigators said Anderson waited in the car for the suspects and drove them back to the east side of Bridgeport. On Wednesday, police said Anderson "acknowledged his role in the incident."  Police have not determined the motive for the shooting.  "Detectives have worked tirelessly on this case, and have done an outstanding job," said Bridgeport Police Capt. James Viadero. "This remains an active investigation."  Anderson is being held on $1 million bond and is expected to arraigned at Bridgeport Superior Court on Friday.    Copyright 2013 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
