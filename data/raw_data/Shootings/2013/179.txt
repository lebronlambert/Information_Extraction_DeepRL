Johnstown police continue to investigate shots fired Monday in the Hornerstown section of the city.  Four males were shot in the area of Horner and Messenger streets, police said.  It’s not clear if they were shooting at each other or were targeted by another person, police said.  “We got a call about 10 p.m. reporting shots fired,” police Chief Craig Foust said. “When officers arrived, they found two individuals with gunshot wounds.”  Both were taken to Memorial Medical Center.  One suffered multiple gunshot wounds.  The other man was shot once in the upper arm before the bullet entered his chest, the chief said.  Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, Foust said.  Foust said police questioned one of the shooting victims at the hospital Monday night.  “He was less than truthful with investigators,” the chief said.  Police later determined  that two other males, one a  17-year-old, also had been shot.  Both were treated at hospitals in Pittsburgh.  Authorities are not sure how they got there.  Johns­town detectives were in Pittsburgh Tuesday night to speak with the victims.  No names will be released until charges are filed, Foust said.  Police recovered part of a handgun’s grip at the scene along with a round and some shell casings.  Police believe are all four men are from the Johnstown area.
