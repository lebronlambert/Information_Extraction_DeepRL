FILED UNDER  ATLANTA, Ga. --Three women and one man were shot just before midnight Friday night as they sat on the porch at their home in the 1000 block of Fair Street.  The four victims were transported to Grady Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.  Atlanta Police spokesman John Chafee says, a preliminary investigation indicates someone in a red, 4-door sedan stopped in front of the victim's home and opened fire on the group, shooting multiple times in their direction. The shooter then fled the scene in the vehicle.  Witnesses at the scene told WXIA the shooting was probably the result of an ongoing feud that recently escalated on social-media.  No arrests have been and the investigation continues.  WXIA
