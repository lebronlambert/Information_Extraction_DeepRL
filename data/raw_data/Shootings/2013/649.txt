CHANNELVIEW, Texas Harris County Sheriff's Office investigators are trying to sort out who shot who after five teenagers were pierced with bullets in east Harris County Sunday afternoon.  It happened around 2 p.m. in the 900 block of Ashland Boulevard.  Deputies arrived to find a boy in his late teens lying on a front lawn. He was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital.  Detectives soon got word that four other teenage victims had already been driven to East Houston Regional Medical Center.  'Was it one group against each other or were there two separate groups? That's the biggest part of what we're trying to find out,' said Deputy Thomas Gilliland with Harris County Sheriff's Office.  Deputies haven't speculated on how the gunfire got started.  Neighbors claim the drama in their community began hours before the shooting when a group of people beat up a woman on crutches.  'The girl got up. She was on a crutch and said, 'This ain't over with.' About two hours later, I heard gunshots,' said a neighbor who asked to be identified only as 'Kay.'  According to several neighbors, constant conflict among two groups of people has left the neighborhood shaken in recent months.  Some residents of the Johnson Place Mobile Home Park said they were terrified to leave home after dark.  'It's not safe to live here, period. I'm moving the first,' said neighbor Brenda Johnson.  No arrests have been made in connection with the Sunday afternoon shootings.  Deputies said the teen airlifted to Memorial Hermann was the most seriously hurt out of those wounded. He was listed in stable condition on Sunday night.  The conditions of the other victims have not been released.  Read or Share this story: http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/20/14141842/
