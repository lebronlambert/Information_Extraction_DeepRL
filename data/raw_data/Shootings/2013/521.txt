(AP) â€” A man was jailed Sunday after a shootout outside of a western Michigan social club killed two men and a woman and injured five others, authorities say.  Muskegon police got a call about 2 a.m. Sunday saying there was gunfire at the Elks Charity Lodge, according to MLive.com.  Police said they found two men dead outside the club. A 20-year-old woman was shot and run over by a driver trying to flee police, police said. She died at a hospital. Police said they were searching Sunday afternoon for the vehicle that struck the woman.  All the victims were from the Muskegon area, police said. They said the five injured all had gunshot wounds.  Muskegon County Prosecutor D.J. Hilson said a man has been jailed in the attack. He was wanted on a warrant that was unrelated to Sunday's shootings, Hilson said.  Muskegon Public Safety Director Jeffrey Lewis said investigators are trying to sort out what happened, with his department's entire detective staff working with officers from other jurisdictions.  "We have a lot of stories," Lewis said. "We think we have some evidence that's going to help us."  The lodge was the site of a shooting in June. A Muskegon man was arrested, MLive.com reported. Other details weren't immediately available.  Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
