OBERLIN — The calls began flooding in to 911 on Thursday night just after four people were shot.  “I just heard a bunch of gunshots, like about six of them, coming from the apartment behind West College Street,” a caller said.  Later, one of the victims called, screaming.  Oberlin police arrived at the apartments at 526 W. College St. to find four victims with gunshot wounds.  The men — Quan Jackson, 23, of Oberlin; Emilio Hernandez, 26, of Lorain; Anthony Lee, 22, of Elyria; and Isiah Richardson, 17, of Oberlin — all were treated and released at the hospital. Police said the men had relatively minor injuries: One man’s head was grazed by a bullet, one had a wound to the arm and two had wounds to lower extremities.  Sean Woodings, 24, of Oberlin, was arrested Thursday night as the suspected shooter, and he was charged Thursday with four counts of felonious assault.  Oberlin police said in a news release Friday that the incident may have been a result of an escalating dispute between the shooter and at least one of the victims.  During Woodings’ arraignment Friday at Oberlin Municipal Court, the prosecutor noted that each of the alleged victims has a significant criminal history, including crimes of violence.  An Oberlin Municipal Court docket states that Woodings was at his home, and it appeared that the men who were shot were trespassing and that at least one of the men was told not to be there.  Woodings was in the process of obtaining a civil protection order against one of the victims, according to court documents.
