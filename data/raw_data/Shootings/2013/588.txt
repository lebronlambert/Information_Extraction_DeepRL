An occupant of the suspect vehicle fired at patrons exiting the restaurant.  A Perris restaurant was the scene of a drive-by shooting early Sunday morning that left five people with gunshot wounds, and police are seeking further information about the bloody incident.    According to a report from the Perris Police Department, the shooting took place around 1:50 a.m. in the 2900 block of Perris Boulevard.  Officers were called to the scene and found four victims suffering from gunshot wounds outside the restaurant, according to the report from Sgt. Ryan Hoxmeier.  “The investigation revealed that a light colored four-door compact style vehicle drove by the front of the restaurant as numerous patrons were exiting. An occupant of the vehicle fired at the patrons exiting the restaurant. A security guard returned fire at the suspect vehicle as it fled the location,” Hoxmeier reported.  The four victims were transported to local hospitals with non-life threatening wounds, and a fifth person, also with non-life threatening gunshot wounds, was later located at a local hospital, the sergeant continued. Hoxmeier’s report did not confirm whether the fifth person was in the suspect vehicle, at the restaurant, or a bystander caught in crossfire.  During the subsequent investigation, police served a warrant in the 26500 block of Ethanac Road in the City of Menifee where the suspect vehicle was allegedly recovered.  The sergeant's report did not indicate whether the case was gang-related nor did he announce any arrests. He did say police are seeking further tips from the public. Those with information about the incident are asked to contact Investigator Heath from the Perris Police Station at (951) 210-1049.
