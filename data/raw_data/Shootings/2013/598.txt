FILED UNDER    JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The victims of a quadruple shooting in Murray Hill are being laid to rest. Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said the investigation is still ongoing and there's no new information on a suspect or motive.  "It's sad, it hurts," said Tashay Brown. She's a cousin of two of the victims, 21-year-old Keshell and 22-year-old Keyonna Brown.  Two others, Derek Williams and Gontrell Hagans were also shot and killed.  Brown told First Coast News having to bury her nieces with no answers as to who killed them, or why, is extremely tough.  "It's just very frustrating," she said. "It makes you mad, you know. Like it's been a week, somebody had to hear something," she added.  The four were shot and killed last Thursday close to 11:00 p.m. Police were at the scene for most of Thursday looking for clues. Brown said anyone that has any information should call Crime Stoppers.  "It's not snitching," she said. "It's about being a good person and doing what's right."  If you have any information, call First Coast Crime Stoppers. The number is 1-866-845-TIPS. It's always anonymous, and you could earn a reward.
