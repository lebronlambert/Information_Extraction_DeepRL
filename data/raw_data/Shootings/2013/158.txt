OBERLIN -- An Oberlin man was charged with four counts of felonious assault after he allegedly shot and wounded four other young men on Thursday night in Oberlin, police said.  The suspect, Sean M. Woodings, 24, pleaded innocent and was released on $5,000 personal bond after appearing in Oberlin Municipal Court yesterday, officials said.  Woodings is accused of shooting Emilio Hernandez, 26, of Lorain; Quan Jackson, 23, of Oberlin; Anthony Lee, 22, of Elyria; and Isiah Richardson, 17, of Oberlin. Police found the four at the apartments at 540 W. College Street.  Hernandez was shot in the arm. Jackson and Richardson were shot in the legs and Lee was grazed in the head by a bullet.

A 9mm handgun and eight spent shell casings were recovered at the scene, McCloskey said.  According to court documents, Woodings was in the process of obtaining a civil protection order against one of the victims prior to the shooting.  Additionally, a written statement by Woodings claims that he was "prompted to use his gun before he was harmed by the alleged victims."  After the shooting, police detained Woodings in the area of 540 W. College Street at about 11:30 p.m. The shooting followed an escalating dispute, said Oberlin Police Lt. Mike McCloskey.  "This situation was pretty unexpected," McCloskey said. "Oberlin is a safe community, and things like this don't happen very frequently."  Woodings is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
