Chicago police say one person was killed, and three more were wounded in a shooting on the city's Far South Side.  According to authorities, a group of people was standing outside in the 600-block of East 131st Street at about 1:50 a.m. Sunday when a fight broke out, and someone fired a gun.  A 28-year-old man was shot multiple times and was found dead at the scene.  A 40-year-old man also was shot multiple times, and a 28-year-old woman suffered a gunshot wound to the back.  Another man, 22, also was shot in the buttocks and was expected to be OK.  Security in the area was high after the shooting. Chicago police were standing with their weapons drawn as paramedics treated the wounded.  No one was in custody as Area South detectives continued to investigate Sunday.  The incident brought the total number of shootings in Chicago over the weekend to more than a dozen.
