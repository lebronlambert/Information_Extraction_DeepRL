CAMPBELL  Police have released the name of the suspect who opened fire in a Seventh Street home early Saturday afternoon, as well as the four family members heâ€™s accused of shooting.  The suspect is 23-year-old Devin Spann, who suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. Police recovered an apparent handwritten homicidal note left by Devin Spann, which proclaims his intention to inflict harm on those close to him.  In January 2011, Devin Spann was arrested on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and drug possession.  The victims are 62-year-old Roland Avis, 43-year-old Mary Lynette Spann, 29-year-old Gerald Robinson, and 24-year-old Carmen Figueroa. Avis, Mary Lynette Spann and Figueroa were shot in the upper torso area, while Robinson was shot in the left forearm.  Also present in the residence were three girls, ages 8, 6 and 3. They were not injured.
