FILED UNDER      OBERLIN, Ohio -- A late-night apartment shooting sent four people to the hospital and one man in police custody.  According to the Oberlin Police Department, officers responded to reports of shots fired in the 500 block of West College Streets.  Upon their arrival around 11:30 p.m., officers found four males -- ages 17, 22, 23 and 26 -- with various gunshot wounds.  Police say the injuries, which have been described as non life-threatening, range from a grazing wound to the head, a wound to the arm and wounds to lower extremities.  A 24-year-old man has been arrested, but authorities aren't releasing his name at this time since he has not yet been formally charged.  A 9 mm handgun and eight spent shell casings were recovered at the scene.  Initial investigation, according to police, indicates the shootings may have resulted from an escalating dispute between the alleged shooter and at least one of the victims.  The shooting remains under investigation.  WKYC-TV
