Seven people were shot, including a 15-year-old fatally shot in the in the head, at what police say was an illegal dice game in west Baltimore Saturday night.  At a hastily convened press conference, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said despite strong police presence in the eastern and western districts, the city has seen a rash of cluster shootings--where several people are shot at once.  "Seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for the city and unacceptable for the us as a whole," said Batts.  Police were called to the 1500 block of W. Fayette Street around 9:15 Saturday night. When officers arrived they found a 15-year-old boy shot in the head. He was taken to Shock Trauma where he later died.  The teen has been identified as Deshaun Jones.  Another six men were shot and are expected to live, according to police spokesman Det. Jeremy Silbert. Two victims ran from the scene and flagged down police officers about a block away. Four others transported themselves to area hospitals.  There are currently no suspects in the shooting. Commissioner Batts said there is no known motive, but noted dice game violence is typically connected to a robbery.  Batts said police are working to get guns off the streets but that is not the only answer to reducing crime. "We need to modify our behavior," he said.  "This is not how we deal with conflict within the city."
