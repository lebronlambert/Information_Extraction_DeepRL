× Man Records Victims Moments after Deadly Shooting  STOCKTON–  Gunfire erupted on Tuesday night right before 10 p.m. in Stockton at Danny’s Market. After the gun smoke cleared, five men were wounded, one didn’t survive.  While people pleaded and screamed for someone to call 9-1-1, a man pulled out his cellphone and hit the record button. Not only did he record the victims, he posted it on Facebook, and included a racial slur as the title.  The man is identified through his Facebook page as Cooper Nowak. We tried tracking him down but came up empty handed.  We even sent him a Facebook message, he didn’t respond.  Tonette Washington saw the video and couldn’t believe her eyes.  “I saw my brother laying on the ground and I’m thinking how did they get this recorded with all the police around,” said Tonette Washington. Her brother Isaiah Wade had to undergo surgery but will survive.  Five men were shot that night. In the video, you see women scrambling to keep their loved one alive and fight until the very end.  “He’s walking around thinking it was funny. My uncle asked him to call 9-1-1, he didn’t and his friend ended up passing away,” said Raeisha Aubrey.  The video is being passed around and shared like it’s nothing on Facebook.
