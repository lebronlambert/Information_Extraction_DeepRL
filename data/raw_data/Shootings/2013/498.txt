One victim has died, and the condition of the other four victims is still unknown.  Investigators say around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, the suspect shot the victims at a store known as "Danny's Market." Detectives say the motive is unclear.  They say no one is in custody, and they are still trying to come up with a description of the shooter.  Investigators are expected to be at the scene for much of the day on Wednesday gathering information.
