SNELLVILLE, Ga., Sept. 25 (UPI) -- The victims in a Gwinnett County, Ga., shooting in which three died were ambushed soon after returning home, police said.  Investigators also said they believe they have the weapon used in the shootings in the Snellville area, as well as the suspect's vehicle, even though the suspect so far hasn't been captured, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday.  Police said Tuesday they believe Robert E. Bell, 33, had an assault rifle and was waiting for Angelina Benton, 34; Benton's son Joseph McDonald, 12; her godson Raynard Daniel, 19, and her boyfriend to return to Benton's home after a weekend trip.  Benton recently allowed Bell to stay in her home, police said.  McDonald and Daniel were shot moments after entering the home while Benton was shot four times outside and collapsed in a neighbor's yard, Gwinnett police Cpl. Deon Washington said. Benton's boyfriend survived a shot in the leg.  "They were pretty much ambushed when they got home," Washington said.  Police theorize Bell, considered armed and dangerous, tried to leave in his vehicle, but Benton, who used the vehicle on the trip, was holding the keys, the Journal-Constitution said.  "We're assuming that his intentions were to leave," Washington said.  Instead, Bell allegedly left on foot, leaving his vehicle behind with two guns in the back, he said.  Investigators said they think he has ties to the Chicago, Albany, Ga., and Crossville, Tenn., areas.
