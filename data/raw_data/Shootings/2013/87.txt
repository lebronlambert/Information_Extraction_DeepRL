The shooting happened just before 4 p.m. after a man knocked on the door of a fifth-floor apartment in the Gravesend Houses, at 2703 West 33rd Street. A woman, 62, answered the door and let the man in. Investigators said he asked to speak with a 24-year-old man who was in a bedroom. The suspect went to the bedroom, shut the door behind him, and shot the other man in the head, the police said. The wounded man was in critical condition at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, the police said.  The suspect left the bedroom, the police said, and shot three other people in the apartment: a 40-year-old man in the living room who suffered a graze wound to the head; the 62-year-old woman, who was shot in the stomach; and another man in the living room, who was shot in the head and died.  The suspect then ran out of the apartment. At the time of the shooting, two boys, ages 10 and 12, and an 18-year-old woman were also inside the apartment. They were unharmed, the police said.  The suspect, identified by the police as Joseph Brown, 29, remained at large on Friday night.
