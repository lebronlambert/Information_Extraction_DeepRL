They were pronounced dead at the scene, a fourth person was transported to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds.  Auburn Police Cmdr. Mike Hirman said some of the victims and suspects knew each other.  Police say two cars that witnesses said left the scene are in custody. One car was found in Kent, the other in Federal Way. The car found in Federal Way has bullets in it.  One person of interest has been detained.  De'sha Timmerman says her brother Lorenzo didn't deserve this.
