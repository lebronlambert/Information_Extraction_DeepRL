An 18-year-old man was arrested Sunday and charged with two separate shootings that occurred in Tuscaloosa on Saturday, one of which killed a 17-year-old girl.  Tresvon Spencer, 18, was taken to the Tuscaloosa County Jail and has been charged with murder and four counts of attempted murder, with a bond of $330,000. According to Loyd Baker, spokesman for the Tuscaloosa County Metro Homicide Unit, Spencer is believed to be the shooter at two separate shootings Saturday, the first of which occurred at 1:10 a.m. Saturday at the intersection of Kaulton Road and Beech Street in Tuscaloosa.  Two men, ages 17 and 18, were shot during an altercation and were taken to DCH Regional Medical Center in a private vehicle for treatment, Baker said. Prior to the shooting, there were “words exchanged” between the victims and Spencer's friends, Baker said.  The 17-year-old was shot in the back and had a fractured vertebrae, Baker said, and is in stable condition in the intensive care unit. The 18-year-old victim had a minor injury to the buttocks and was released after treatment.  Later on Saturday, Spencer reportedly shot 17-year-old Angelica Mona Golston and two other females inside an apartment at Creekwood Village Apartments near Stillman College at about 11:55 p.m. Golston died from her injuries. The other females, age 22 and 30, were treated and released at DCH for injuries that were not life-threatening.  “The motive in the apartment shooting is unclear,” Baker said. “(The) shooting appears unprovoked.”  Spencer was later arrested by the U.S. Marshals Task Force in a house in Tuscaloosa early Sunday morning.
