Police received the call around 2:15 a.m. Neighbors said they were awakened by the sound of multiple gun shots. When they looked outside they said they saw about 150 kids in the street -- four were victims of gunfire and one happened to be their 17-year-old grandson.  Family members rushed him to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the stomach. Another victim, an unidentified 19-year-old man, died in the shooting.  Detectives are focusing their investigation on a blasted-out window and an alley between a house and a vacant lot.  An old neighborhood church stands as symbol of peace and hope. Its reverend and congregation continue to pray and seek ways to help reduce the violence.  "My job as a reverend of the church is to keep on talking and praying to them," said Rev. Melvin Lewis Sr., associate pastor at Bowers Memorial Church. "We can't just turn our back and let things go and think they will change. Thing will never change if you don't try to make it change."  Police said the victims in the shooting were young black and Hispanic males. Their identities have not been released. Anyone with information is asked to call the TIPS Hotline at 816.474.TIPS.
