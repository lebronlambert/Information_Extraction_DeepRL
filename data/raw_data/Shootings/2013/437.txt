An Oklahoma City man who told police he had to get away from his family because they were preventing him from being with his one true love was charged Tuesday with killing four of them, including his mother and infant nephew.  Oklahoma County prosecutors filed four counts of first-degree murder against Daniel Livingston Green.  Green, said to be obsessed with actress and former Disney star Selena Gomez, is accused of fatally shooting all four victims with a handgun.  Green, 40, was arrested Thursday, a day after police discovered four of his relatives had been fatally shot inside the family's home, 4601 SE 79. He remains in the Oklahoma County jail; bail has been denied.  The victims were identified as Green's mother, Sallie Green, 57; his sister, Rebecca Cizek, 34; and Cizek's children, Katherine Cizek, 16, and Amario Dominguez III, who was 6 months old.  When police took Green into custody, they found a .380-caliber semi-automatic pistol in the passenger seat of the vehicle he was driving. He told police he could have “emptied a magazine on them,” according to an affidavit signed by a police officer and filed in Oklahoma County District Court. The officer wrote that Green told him he was on his way to California to be with his true love.  A search of the vehicle also turned up two bottles of gin, a box of .380-caliber ammunition, a magazine for a .380-caliber pistol and a U.S. interstate highway map, according to papers filed Tuesday with the Oklahoma County District Court Clerk's office.  Green's father, Raymond Green, told police that all of his guns were locked up in the house, but his daughter's gun, a .380-caliber pistol, was hidden in the attic, according to court papers filed in the case.
