(WMC-TV) - A 22-year-old man was killed, and four others were injured when several men reportedly started shooting at a Whitehaven apartment complex Wednesday evening.  When officers arrived to the Birch Leaf Apartments, located at 1033 Whitaker Drive, around 8:30 p.m., one man was already dead. Four others, who are men ranging in age from 21 to 25, were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Two were treated and released, while the other two are in stable condition.  Investigators say several men, who were armed with weapons, opened fire and then may have fled the scene in a dark-colored SUV.  Trina Watson says her cousins were victims in the shooting, which she says was done in retaliation for something.  "Whatever it was about, they meant business," said Watson.  Residents say the gate the gunmen entered is usually locked, so it is not clear how they were able to get inside. They say trouble at Birch Leaf Apartments, a very large complex, is rare.
