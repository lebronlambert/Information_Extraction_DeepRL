A 17-year-old has been charged in the death of a 15-year-old who was shot, along with four other people, at a birthday party over the weekend.  Greenwood police arrested Dayterrius White at his home on West Crestville Avenue in Greenwood on Sunday night.  White is charged with murder. Police said additional charges against White are pending.  Around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, officers near the detention center heard shots being fired, according to Greenwood police.  Lt. Travis Anderson told WYFF that it happened during a birthday party on Tabor Street. Anderson said one of the shooting victims ran to the police station and told officers about what happened.  Five victims were shot, four of whom had non-life-threatening injuries.  Anderson said the victim who died was 15-years-old and had a gunshot wound to the chest. The coroner identified the victim as Malik Padgett.  This incident remains under investigation.  On Sunday, community members held a "Walk for Peace" in response to Saturday's violence.  "It’s sad that things like this, tragedy, have to happen, but, it’s a sign also... We got to do something, and it’s something that that’s going to take not just one person but everybody," Tish Turner said.
