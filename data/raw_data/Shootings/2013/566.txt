A NEIGHBOUR who slaughtered a family of four and then turned the gun on himself may have been enraged about the noise of barking dogs.  The murders took place at a quiet townhouse complex in Phoenix, Arizona.  Michael Dante Guzzo shattered the peaceful neighbourhood when he shot dead his next-door neighbours Bruce Moore, 66; his daughter, Renee, 36; her husband, Michael, 42 and their son, Shannon, 17. He also killed two dogs belonging to the family.  According to media reports Renee Moore ran a dog grooming business.  Denise Lopez, a neighbour of the killer, said Guzzo had previously argued with pet owners about barking dogs and left notes complaining about the noise.  "He didn't want noise," Lopez told the Phoenix Times. "The dogs were waking him up. He always used to complain."  Following the shootings Guzzo reportedly walked across the courtyard to where a Chihuahua and pit bull had begun barking.  Libni DeLeon, the owner of the dogs, said Guzzo banged and kicked on the front door. He then shot a hole in the door.  DeLeon told the paper that he sent his girlfriend and children upstairs, following them up shortly afterwards to retrieve his gun.  "A man's got to protect his family," DeLeon said.  Guzzo, who lived alone, then returned to his own property. His body was later found there by police.
