Investigators say four people have been found shot to death in a car near a former Tennessee mountain resort.  State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm says the car was found near an abandoned guard shack Thursday at a resort community about 50 miles west of Knoxville.  The Renegade Mountain Resort was built in 1969 as part of a gated community. It had a lounge, restaurant, lodge and ski slope. But the lodge burned down in 2000.  The area is large, wooded and isolated, with 43 full-time residents.  Homeowners association President John Moore says a resident found the bodies on the way to work. The car was about 100 feet off a main road.  Moore says the community's owners got rid of the controlled access in 2010.
