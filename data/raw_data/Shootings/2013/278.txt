PATERSON, N.J. (AP) — One woman was killed and three people were wounded when two gunmen opened fire on a northern New Jersey street.  Paterson police tell The Record that the shooting occurred around 2:30 a.m. Saturday near Park Avenue and East 22nd Street. A motive remains under investigation, and it’s not clear if any of the victims were targeted by the assailants.  A 20-year-old city resident who was struck in the abdomen was pronounced dead at the scene. A 21-year-old Paterson woman shot in the left hip was treated at a hospital and released later Saturday.  The two other wounded victims remained hospitalized late Saturday afternoon _ a 39-year-old Paterson women shot in the upper chest and a 48-year-old Plainfield man who suffered wounds in the right hand, right leg and groin.
