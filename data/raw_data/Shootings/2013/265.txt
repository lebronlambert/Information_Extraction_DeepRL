BERKELEY • Three people were seriously injured and another was killed in a shootout Tuesday that broke out on a parking lot outside of the Madelaine Manor Apartments.  Three of those shot sped away from the apartment complex and were found by police nearby on James S. McDonnell Boulevard. All four of the shooting victims were taken to hospitals, where one of the four was pronounced dead.  The identities of those shot were not released Tuesday.  They were a woman and three men. They are in their late 20s to early 30s, Berkeley Police Maj. Art Jackson said.  “We believe they were shooting at each other and there is no danger to the public at this point,” he said.  Jackson said the group had been in an argument shortly before 2 p.m. on the parking lot along the 9500 block of Madelaine Manor Walk before they exchanged gunfire. He was unsure how many shots had been fired.  Terry Steed, 33, of Normandy was at the apartment complex visiting his two young daughters at their mother’s apartment. He said he heard two bursts of shots — first seven shots, then two or three more.  “You could really tell there was a battle going on,” he said.  He and others in the complex emerged from the apartments after the shooting died down. He said he saw a silver car speed off and a man on the pavement bleeding from a wound to his upper chest. A woman was applying pressure to the man’s wound.  “He was bleeding pretty bad,” he said. “I could just see him laying in a puddle of his blood.”  Authorities found three guns after the shootout.
