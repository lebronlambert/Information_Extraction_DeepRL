One of the men was pronounced dead at the scene.  Among the other victims was a 24-year-old man who was shot in the head and listed in critical condition, a 40-year-old man who was grazed in the head and treated at the scene and a 62-year-old woman who was shot in the stomach and hospitalized in critical condition.  The NYPD said a preliminary investigation determined that 29-year-old Joseph Brown entered the apartment and shot the victims. The motive is under investigation.  Witnesses told CBS 2’s Derricke Dennis that the victims are members of the same family, possibly brothers and their mother.
