The New Orleans Police Department said that five people were shot in Central City on Monday afternoon. Police said that the shooting occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on the corner of LaSalle Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.    The shooting occurred near where the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade had passed some 30 minutes earlier. The shooting did not appear to be related to the parade, authorities said.  New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas said that the shots were fired out of a white, two-door sedan that drove by a grocery store located near the intersection of both streets. Rapid shots were fired at a group of teenagers who were standing outside.    Five people were shot, Serpas said. All of the victims were male, Serpas said, and they were taken to an area hospital to be treated for their injuries, none of which appeared to be life-threatening.    The car was seen fleeing down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard toward the river and disappeared into the surrounding neighborhood, Serpas said, adding that video surveillance would soon be made available to the public.    Authorities said the shooting did not appear to be related to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade, which passed by about 30 minutes prior as residents participated in the 27th annual march to King's statue on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.    "It's the state of affairs in our nation that young men do not heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr.," Serpas said.  Check back in with NOLA.com for more on this breaking story.
