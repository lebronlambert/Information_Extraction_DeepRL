A victim is taken to ambulance after being shot in the 600 block of West Princess Street just before midnight Monday. (Steven Goeller )  Four people shot late Monday night in York City's west end are expected to survive their wounds, police said.  One of the victims is a 17-year-old girl from the 600 block of West Princess Street, where the shooting happened, according to police.  The others are Daquez Palmer, 20, of the 900 block of Madison Avenue; Joseph Ramos, 18, of the 600 block of West College Avenue; and QueSean Brown, 18, of the 100 block of South Richland Avenue.  Brown was treated at York Hospital and released, a hospital spokeswoman said; conditions on the other three victims could not be obtained.  York City Police said the four were in the 600 block of West Princess Street about 11:55 p.m. Monday when shots rang out. All four were hit and subsequently taken to York Hospital by ambulance, police said.  Officers collected shell casings from two different caliber bullets, meaning at least two people were firing, according to police.  Brown told officers he was sitting on the front porch of a home in the block when he heard five or six gunshots and ran inside the home, which is when he realized he'd been shot in the hand, police said.  Officers focused their investigation in front of a grocery store at the corner of South Belvidere Avenue and West Princess Street.  There, a number of bullet casings were on the sidewalk on the South Belvidere Avenue side of the building. Another shell casing was found by officers about halfway down the block on West Princess Street.  Advertisement  No arrests had been made as of Tuesday morning, police said.  Anyone with information about the shootings is asked to call city detectives at 849-2219.
