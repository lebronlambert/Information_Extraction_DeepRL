Meek Mill’s Delaware Concert Ends In Gunfire, 4 People Shot [PHOTOS]  Meek Mill recently showed his tranquil side this past Thanksgiving but his music still seems to be inciting violence at venues across the country.  The MMG star pupil was performing in Wilmington, DE the early morning of December 7 when shots rang out after the show, reports the AP.  State police spokesman Sgt. Paul Shavack says that when troopers arrived at the Moodswing Niteclub in Wilmington just before 2 a.m. Saturday, about 600 to 700 people were in the parking lot trying to get away from the shooting. They were running and in their cars. Troopers said they could hear multiple gunshots by more than one shooter being fired within the crowd that was there to see the popular rapper. Shavack says two victims were treated at the scene and taken to hospitals and friends took two others for treatment.  The good news is all the injuries from the three men and one woman were not life-threatening. The bad news is obvious. Detractors of Hip-Hop have more fuel for their fire this winter season.  Hit the gallery for pics of the scene. Naturally there are no suspects to question at the time.  —  Photo: Delaware Online, Instagram  Email This  Leave a Comment
