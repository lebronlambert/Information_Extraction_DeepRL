A 17-year-old girl fatally shot at an event before a prom was a sophomore at Saginaw High School.  School district spokeswoman Safiya Mosley identified her as Tonquinisha McKinley. The shooting occurred Thursday night in a parking lot, miles away from where the Saginaw High prom was being held.  Police say at least three other females were injured. Mosley says students and families are regularly advised not to gather for unofficial events before prom.  The prom went on as scheduled at Crooked Creek Banquet Center, although students and school officials were aware of the shooting.  Mosley says officials wanted students to enjoy the much-anticipated prom.
