Iredell County Sheriff's Deputies and officers from the Statesville Police Department responded to the American Legion Post on Wallace Springs Road in Statesville on Saturday to find four teen-aged victims suffering from gunshot wounds.  All four victims were taken to Iredell Memorial Hospital, then three of them were subsequently transferred to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for surgery. The victims, whose ages ranged from 15 to 19, did not suffer life threatening injuries, officials say.  Witnesses on the scene told officers there were three fights at the birthday party in a short period of time, the first of which they say was quickly broken up. The second, witnesses said started on the dance floor before moving outside. Meanwhile, the third fight started inside with five to six people reportedly beating on a victim with chairs.  Deputies say while security and bystanders worked to break up the chair fight inside, multiple shots were fired outside.  Detectives were able to get a vague description of the shooter: a light-skinned black male with dreadlocks, who was seen wearing a short-sleeved white t-shirt.  Witnesses told authorities the suspect may have fled the scene in a red or burgundy Nissan passenger car.  Detectives say some of the witnesses were uncooperative, and ask anyone with information to come forward by calling the Sheriff's Office at (704) 878-3180 or Crime Stoppers at (704) 662-1340.
