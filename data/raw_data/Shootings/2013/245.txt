An 18-year-old woman was killed when she and four others were hit by gunfire.  Witnesses tell ABC7 that shots rang out from the passenger side of a vehicle driving by slowly as some friends were on a porch enjoying the weather.  It happened about 5:00 p.m. Monday in Englewood near 57th and Sangamon.  A short time after they arrived Monday evening, relatives and friends learned April McDaniel,18, died of a gunshot to the chest. Relatives suspect it was a gang member who fired the shots, but they say she was not involved in gangs.  April's cousin Charles Drane is one of three other victims seriously injured. Paramedics transported another with less serious injuries. Relatives are at a loss.  "I hope they catch whoever did this," said Virginia Jackson, an aunt of one of the victims.  A jeep burns in an alley about a mile from where the shooting happened earlier. Police believe it was the vehicle a gunman was in when he opened fire at a group of young people standing on a porch.  Investigators marked numerous shell casings at the scene.
