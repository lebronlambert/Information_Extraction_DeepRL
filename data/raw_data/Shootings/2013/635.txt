Four people were shot in Wilmington, Del., early Saturday as gunfire erupted after an event hosted by Philly rapper Meek Mill.  Troopers shortly before 2 a.m. responded to the parking lot of MoodSwing Nightclub Lounge, located in the 3400 block of Kirkwood Highway.  There, they could hear gunshots being fired by multiple people into a crowd of between 600 and 700 patrons who were fleeing the chaos on foot and in cars.  After officers wrested the melee under control, they found three men - aged 21, 22, and 24 - and one woman, 33, had been shot. Paramedics rushed two victims to local hospitals, while two people were driven by friends to area emergency rooms. Police said all four victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Five cars were also damaged by gunfire.
