HAWTHORNE (CBSLA.com) — A man was gunned down and three others were wounded at a New Year’s Eve party in Hawthorne.  The incident happened shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday in the 13500 block of Cerise Avenue.  Investigators said four people were shot when an argument escalated at a party with more than 40 people in attendance.  An unidentified mother of two who lives a few houses away from where the shooting occurred said she kept her kids inside when she heard a fight.  “I didn’t see it actually happen, but I heard that somebody just walked up and started shooting…we heard a lot of loud arguing, and we heard a lot of gunshots. Then I also heard a car speeding off after the gunshots,” the woman told CBS2’s Kristine Lazar.  Police said a person in the speeding car was driving one of the victims to the hospital. That man later died.  The three other victims were taken to the hospital and are expected to survive.  Another woman who wished to remain anonymous told Lazar that she believes gangs are to blame for what happened.  “From my understanding, Hawthorne does not belong to one gang. It’s a melting pot of all different gangs, which is what makes it so dangerous,” she said.  Officials haven’t yet made any arrests in connection to the shootings.
