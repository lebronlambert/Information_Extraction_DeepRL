The victims were beaten so badly their bodies were almost unrecognizable  Ronald Martinez / Getty Images  Police in Alabama are piecing together clues from a grisly multiple homicide after four people were found beaten and shot to death in a vehicle early on Thursday.  Winston County Sheriff Rick Harris told WBRC that four people were found in the car on a rural road near Double Springs, about 90 minutes from Birmingham, and that the victims were beaten so badly their bodies were almost unrecognizable. He added, however, that the likely cause of death was gunshot wounds.  “Right now we have more questions than answers,” Harris said.  The identities, ages and genders of the victims are not known, police say, because of how badly they were beaten.  [WBRC]
