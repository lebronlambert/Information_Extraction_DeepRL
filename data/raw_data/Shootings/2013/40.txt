When police responded to a 911 call at her home Wednesday morning, they found a bloody scene, which they eventually classified as a murder-suicide, police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez told the Los Angeles Times.  Before turning the gun on herself, 22-year-old Mayra Perez fatally shot her daughter, Nevaeh Morales, and her son, Erick Perez, and critically injured her youngest daughter, Isabel Perez, police said. All the children were younger than 7, authorities said.  In a news conference Thursday at Denver Health Medical Center, where Isabel remained in critical condition, Perez’s brother Tony Nuñez gave an emotional statement.
