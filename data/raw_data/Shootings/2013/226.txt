Audio Clip Homicide Possible For Five Bodies In Arizona Desert  TUCSON, Ariz. -- The bodies of five people were found Tuesday morning in the southern Arizona desert and are now being investigated as possible homicides.  Pima County Medical Examiner Greg Hess said the discoveries were suspicious. U.S. Border Patrol agents working on the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation found the bodies and reported them to tribal police. The FBI is also investigating the scene. Tohono O’odham police refused to comment on the investigation.  The remains of immigrants who try to cross the border region illegally are commonly found in the desert.  But the medical examiner said the area where these bodies were discovered was an unusual place for immigrants to try to cross through. He said the bodies had been covered partially with rocks.  An autopsy will be conducted next Tuesday.
