Two people are dead and five injured, including a sheriff, after a gunman in Central Texas opened fire on several vehicles, apparently at random, authorities said.  The Texas Department of Public Safety said the gunman is among the dead. His identity was not released Monday, but authorities said he was a 23-year-old North Carolina resident.  DPS said the shootings began about 4:30 a.m. Sunday when the gunman shot a motorist in the Eden area in Concho County, about 40 miles southeast of San Angelo. Over the next 90 minutes, he's suspected of shooting two people who were sitting in a car at a convenience store in McCulloch County and then another motorist back in adjacent Concho County.  Shortly after 6 a.m., a 41-year-old woman, Alicia Torres, was found dead in her car in Eola, just east of San Angelo.  The suspect fired on the vehicle of Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane when the sheriff came upon him north of Eden, according to DPS. Doane was wounded in the gunfire and hospitalized.  A state trooper and game warden came upon the scene and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was killed.  An assault rifle, handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were recovered, DPS said.  Concho County authorities deferred comment Monday to the DPS office in Austin. Phone messages left there were not immediately returned.
