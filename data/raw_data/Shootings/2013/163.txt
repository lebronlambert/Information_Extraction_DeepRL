CHARLOTTE, N.C Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police are looking for a gunman after a shooting early Saturday morning that left five people injured, including one person with life-threatening injuries.  CMPD spokesman Keith Trietley said in a statement Saturday that police were called to William Reynolds Drive in the Hickory Grove Division just before 2:45 a.m., after getting a call about the shooting.  The caller told police people were injured.  Police found five men suffering from gunshot wounds. Three victims were taken to Carolinas Medical Center-Main, and two were taken to CMC-University.
