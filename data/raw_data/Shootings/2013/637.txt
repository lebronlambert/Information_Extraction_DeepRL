HARTFORD, Conn. â€” A Connecticut man who authorities say killed three women and himself at an apartment complex was the father of one victim's toddler son and had a legal dispute with her over child support payments.  Police and relatives on today identified the victims of Saturday night's shootings in Manchester as 28-year-old Brittany Mills of Manchester, Conn. and her cousins, 23-year-old Kamesha Mills of Manchester and 46-year-old Artara Benson of Union Township in Union County, N.J.  Police say 41-year-old John Lynn killed the three women in Brittany Mills' apartment and left the building carrying a 13-month-old child. Authorities say Lynn let the child go unharmed shortly before fatally shooting himself in front of officers.  Court records show Lynn and Brittany Mills had a child support case earlier this year involving their 13-month-old son.
